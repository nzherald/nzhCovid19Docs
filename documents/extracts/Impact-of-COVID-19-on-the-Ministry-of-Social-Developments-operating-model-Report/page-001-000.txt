To: Hon Carmel Sepuloni, Minister for Social Development

Impact of COVID-19 on the Ministry of Social Developmentâ€™s

operating model

Purpose of the report

1. This report seeks your agreement to a number of changes to the Ministry of Social
Development's (MSD) operating model that aim to:

1.1. manage demand for services; and
1.2. ensure the health and safety of clients and staff by minimising potential
opportunities for COVID-19 community transmission.

Recommended actions

It is recommended that you:

1 note that the unprecedented social and economic impacts of COVID-19 requires the
Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to make urgent changes to its operating model in
order to manage demand for services and ensure the health and safety of clients and
staff

2 note that MSD proposes to take a phased approach to implementing changes to its
operating model based on ease of implementation, impact on client experience and staff
capacity, fiscal risk and precedent-setting

3 agree that all proactive face-to-face engagement with clients ceases, including
engagement for the purposes of administering hardship assistance and offering
employment support

Agree / Disagree

4 note that this will mean that MSD will be unlikely to require clients to complete work-
related activities as part of their obligations to take steps to find suitable employment,
as this would not be reasonable in most circumstances

5 agree to seek Cabinet agreement to delay the commencement of client contributions to
Emergency Housing, which will require 21 dedicated processing staff, in order to free up
frontline staff capacity

Agree / Disagree
