Background

Temporary border control measures

1. On 1 February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealand’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.

2. On 14 February 2020, Ministers with Power to Act agreed to extend the temporary border
measures for anyone who has been present in or transited through mainland China within
the last 14 days until 24 February 2020.

3. Ministers with Power to Act have agreed to extend the temporary border measures to those
who try to enter New Zealand within 14 days of disembarking from the Diamond Princess
cruise ship.

4. We understand that Cabinet has today agreed to extend the temporary border measures for
a further 8 days until 3 March 2020.

5. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control
measures:

a. New Zealand citizens

b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders

c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder

d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand

e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrival’ by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers
(who travel to New Zealand as part of a scheduled cruise) and marine and aircraft
crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific expedition under the
auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.

Amendment to Border Entry instructions

Proposed new immigration instructions

6. _ The following changes to immigration instructions are proposed:

a. expand the scope of the temporary border measures to refuse entry permission to
any person who attempts to travel to New Zealand within 14 days of disembarking
the Diamond Princess cruise ship (IMO: 9228198, flagged to the United Kingdom),
operated by Princess Cruises; and

* Although deemed to hold entry permission it is possible to suspend their visa waiver status for Cruise ship

passengers and marine and aircraft crew at any point between embarkation onto the craft and arrival in New

Zealand. It may also be possible to revoke their entry permission and cancel their visa on arrival if they arrive

in an immigration control area.
