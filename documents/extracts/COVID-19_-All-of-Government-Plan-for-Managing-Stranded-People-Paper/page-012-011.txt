5 Agree that in the interim the moratorium on approving foreign government
assisted charter flights should continue

6 Agree that officials should assure foreign governments that the New Zealand
Government is working through these issues as a matter of urgency while the
moratorium is in place.

7 Note that while they wait to be evacuated, stranded foreign nationals will need to
shelter in place and that many will have the means to do support themselves, but
where they do not:

7.1. consular assistance from their own governments and travel insurance
should be the first port of call;

7.2 some may also be able to continue work to support themselves, including
in essential services; and

7.3 limited support can be made available to match these people to suitable
accommodation, to access emergency healthcare, and, as a last resort,
access to emergency support through regional Civil Defence and
Emergency Management Groups.

8 Note that these measures would be temporary and undertaken on an
extraordinary basis, in light of the overriding public health interests associated
with a pandemic. If we do not achieve widespread compliance with limitations on
people movements, we risk having to keep Level 4 in place for longer.

9 Note that communication of these measures should be clear that this support is
time limited and that this does not create a precedent for future situations.

10 Note that demand for support from stranded foreign nationals is uncertain, but
currently low. 59(2)(FV(iv), $9(2)(a)(i) $9(2)(g)(i)
