28 If these conditions cannot be met then clear guidance will be conveyed to seek
health advice (if symptomatic) or to remain in situ for fourteen days (since coming
into close contact with a confirmed case). This further justifies the need to work
with international governments to stagger evacuation flights in order to give
access to those completing their isolation period.

Managed evacuation of stranded foreign nationals will then be required

29 ~_—s As arriving New Zealanders reduce in number, we will have more space to
manage evacuation of foreign nationals out of New Zealand. This will necessitate
a highly managed process, similar to arrivals, in order to meet the public health
objectives of Level 4, including:

29.1 facilitated domestic transport of foreign nationals from across New
Zealand to international departure points to minimise transmission risk

29.2 appropriate health screening measures for those departing to ensure that
they are able to board flights, and

29.3. government to government agreements to allow transit through third
countries and, in some cases, transit through New Zealand for
evacuations from eg the Pacific.

30 Work is underway to develop the operational plan for an assisted departures
process for these evacuations (Annex 1 sets out the high level approach in
development)1

33 In the interim, ahead of mass evacuations being organised, it is critical that
foreign nationals shelter in place to support the lock down being effective, and do
not undermine the public health objectives of shifting to Alert Level 4.

Overview of foreign nationals unable to depart New Zealand under Level 4

34 There are currently around 383,000 temporary student, visitor, and work visa
holders in New Zealand. We estimate that:

34.1 around a quarter of these are stranded foreign nationals — people who had
only planned to be in New Zealand for a very short period and cannot
secure a flight home, however
