Living assistance

50 Accommodation and financial support would only be provided on the basis of
genuine need, as many foreign nationals will be able to support themselves
through the lockdown period.

51 Cabinet agreed last week to an amendment to the Guide to the National Civil
Defence Emergency Management Plan 2015 (‘the Guide’) to enable local
authorities to be reimbursed by government for costs they incur in providing
welfare support to people who are self-isolating or sheltering in place —
previously they could only do so in relation to displaced people.

52 Welfare support includes accommodation support, food, and transportation
required to support self-isolation / confinement due to COVID-19. Local
authorities / CDEM Groups have discretion to decide who (including foreign
nationals) should receive welfare support, based on their assessment of
an applicant’s need. They do not provide direct financial assistance to individuals
but work with government agencies, NGOs, community-based organisations and
commercial providers to match, procure or contract the provision of essential
goods and services to meet identified and prioritised needs.

53 The level of demand for material assistance and the duration of travel disruptions
are unknown. Officials will monitor the situation in the coming weeks. If demand,
including from foreign nationals, exceeds local authority and CDEM response
capacity, scheme funding could be increased to ensure safe self-isolation
