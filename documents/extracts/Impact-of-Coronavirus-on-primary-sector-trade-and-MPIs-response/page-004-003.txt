Security Level — In Confidence
. Rock lobster: China is the leading export market for live rock lobster, accounting
for 99% of all exports. The outbreak has significantly impacted demand for rock
lobsters. §9@a@

This has
come at an unfortunate time for exporters with a large volume of rock lobsters
being held in New Zealand holding facilities to meet export demand for Chinese
New Year celebrations (25 Jan — 8 Feb). Fisheries New Zealand is working with
industry to actively consider options that might provide relief to fishers and
exporters at this time. MPI proposes to consult and advise on an urgent
amendment to regulations to allow carry forward of up to 10% of uncaught annual
catch entitlement (ACE). This amendment will need to be made before the start
of the new fishing year on 1 April. Separate briefing information will be provided
on this.

3. These impacts will likely have flow on effects to employment and labour for the primary
sectors. For example, there are reports some forestry crews across New Zealand have
temporarily closed operations and logging workers have been told to go home.

4. MPI will be checking with port operators to get further information on the flow-on
impacts on New Zealand ports from the Chinese supply-chain slow-down.

5. China's notified market access conditions for food and primary products remain
unchanged, along with registrations and listings for New Zealand food and primary
product premises. Further information on official references to Coronavirus from China
are attached as Appendix Two.

MPI’s response and engagement with primary sector exporters

6. The New Zealand Government has limited ability to manage many of the risks and
disruptions as a result of Coronavirus — including port and transport delays and
changes in market conditions. MPI is however working to ensure exporters are updated
on the situation so they can implement their own contingency plans.

7. To minimise risk and gather the latest information, MPI/MFAT/NZTE (including its
Beijing based representatives) are seeking information from New Zealand businesses
and officials based in China around the impacts of Coronavirus on their operations,
supply chains, and the regulatory settings.

8. MPI/MFAT/NZTE/Customs working level officials convened today to further coordinate
the NZ Inc. response and messaging, and to discuss how we can best support the
primary sectors.

9. MPI/MFAT are undertaking analysis on the longer-term economic impacts of
Coronavirus and will report to Ministers and industry on their findings.

10. MPI is using its communication channels and the Export Regulatory Advice Service
(ERAS) to ensure that primary sector exporters, including smaller exporters, are kept
informed of developments and can put contingency plans in place.
