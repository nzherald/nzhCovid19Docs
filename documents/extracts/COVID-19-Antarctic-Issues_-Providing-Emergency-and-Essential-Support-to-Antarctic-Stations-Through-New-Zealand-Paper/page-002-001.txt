Principles for considering Antarctic issues in the COVID-19 context

7 The considerations in this paper prioritise:

e Limiting COVID-19 risks to New Zealand and Antarctica arising from Antarctic
operations;

e Applying requirements consistent with New Zealand’s response to COVID-19,
including the requirements of Alert Level 4;

e Providing the essentials for life in Antarctica including the provision of supplies, and
coordinating emergency evacuations and search and rescue functions; and

e Maintaining New Zealand's strategic interests in Antarctica, including New Zealand’s
role as an Antarctic gateway country.

Antarctic related movements: decisions required to enable essential support

7. There are three cases of movements of people, aircraft and vessels that require the

consideration of this Committee, as follows:

Flights to Scott Base and McMurdo in April 2020

8. In order to prepare McMurdo Station and Scott Base for the winter months and as part of

shared logistics arrangements, the United States Antarctic Programme (USAP) and
Antarctica New Zealand (Antarctica NZ) have planned re-supply flights to occur in April
(weather and runway conditions permitting). These flights are required to deliver essential
medical and other supplies to the stations and to return approximately 120 USAP
personnel from McMurdo and one New Zealander from Scott Base. The USAP and
Antarctica NZ have stressed that it is essential for the health and safety of these
personnel that they be uplifted from Antarctica in the next month. These personnel had
not intended to “winter” in Antarctica,

9. The flights are planned to be conducted by an Australian aircraft

The Australian airbus would fly from Melbourne to
Antarctica in early to mid-April (weather permitting) to collect passengers from Antarctica
before continuing on to New Zealand. It would then conduct further (two or three) flights
to and from Antarctica to deliver essential cargo (which is currently in Christchurch) and
