23. Berthing of the Araon includes cargo handling and bunkering. Any cargo offloaded would
be within the Ministry of Transport guidelines for essential cargo. The cargo operations
schedule has been minimised to only discharge and load those items which are
necessary and limit interactions and time required for port staff. The cargo handling and
bunkering schedule has been reduced from the usual five day port stay to two days.

Search and Rescue

24. As noted above, New Zealand has an obligation to coordinate search and rescue for the
Ross Sea sector of Antarctica. In practice, this means coordinating flights (conducted by
New Zealand or other aircraft) or tasking vessels as required to respond to various
emergency situations, including potentially medical evacuation, in the Ross Sea region.
Rescue coordination is an essential service which will continue, including in relation to
Antarctica.

Preparation for next season

25. Officials will revert to the Committee by August to seek decisions on the essential support
required to prepare the stations for the “spring” transition. s9(2)(f) (iv)

Currently, foreign nationals who want to enter
New Zealand in order to travel to Antarctica as part of a National Antarctic Programme
are subject to the current travel restrictions.

Financial implications

26. There are no financial implications arising from the decisions in this paper.

with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the
Ministry of Defence, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Transport,
