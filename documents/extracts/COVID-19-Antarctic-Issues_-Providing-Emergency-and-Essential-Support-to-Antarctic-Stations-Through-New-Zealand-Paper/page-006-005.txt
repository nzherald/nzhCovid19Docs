Recommendations

The Minister of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Committee:

Essential Support to Antarctic Stations

1 note that in March 2020, Cabinet directed that the Ministry of Health and Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade officials (CVD-20-MIN-0017 refers) provide further advice
to Ministers on related issues concerning Antarctica travel;

2 note that the MoH has confirmed that there are currently no COVID-19 related risks
associated with people coming from Antarctica; COVID-19 is not present in
Antarctica;

3 note that as an Antarctic “gateway” country, New Zealand has an essential role in
supporting Antarctic stations in the Ross Sea region;

4 note that April is a critical month for preparing Antarctic stations for the winter;

5 note that provision for essential and emergency support to Antarctic stations through
New Zealand is required as part of our Antarctic responsibilities, as well as to keep
New Zealanders in Antarctica safe, and can be delivered whilst preventing increased
COVID-19 related risks to people in New Zealand or in Antarctica;

6 note that all personnel proposed to return from Antarctica to New Zealand, as part of
the movements described in this paper, will go into self-funded self-isolation on arrival
in New Zealand. For the foreign nationals, this will be until such time as they are
evacuated from New Zealand (and in accordance with any requirements for the
evacuation of foreign nationals) or the 14 days have passed, after which they would
be required to comply with the alert level 4 restrictions. Plans for self-isolation will be
scrutinised before arrival in New Zealand and Government officials, including from
Ministry of Health, will also need to be satisfied as to the adequacy of the proposed
self-isolation arrangements upon arrival;

7 note that MBIE has confirmed that provision of support to Scott Base is an essential
service;

8 note that officials will revert to the Committee by August to seek decisions on the
essential support required to prepare the stations for the “spring” transition.
