50 Additional messages (for China and around student welfare)
* Wecommend the rapid containment measures taken by China
e We value the contribution these students make to New Zealand and look forward to
welcoming them as soon as we can
* New Zealand will lift restrictions when it is safe to do so
e« Where students have been outside of mainland China for 14 days, these restrictions to
not apply
* — Self-isolation is best practice, but we also need to be able to look after individuals,
particularly those from offshore and ensure necessary support
¢ The welfare of these students is extremely important to us and their families

. We recognise the interruption to their studies and are taking the following steps to
mitigate this:

° For school students, we have made available our online system (Te Kura) enabling all
primary and secondary students to continue their education at home and with their
families. As soon as restrictions are lifted, they will be able to fully reintegrate

° For tertiary students, some will be able to resume studies. Where there are fixed term
dates, we are working with providers to minimise disruption to studies and a range of
other assistance is being considered.

° We recognise some visas will be expiring during the restriction period — for those
students, we will proactively contact them so they can apply for a short term visa which
will be expedited to allow them to enter NZ and apply for a substantive visa as is the
normal practice

. Collectively, these measures will support the welfare of these students and allow them
to successfully enter, settle and study in NZ as soon as possible

51 Further work is underway to develop communications to support an announcement on an
exemption, if you choose to do this.
