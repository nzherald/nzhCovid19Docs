MANATU HAUORA,
Appendix 3: Immigration Requirements
MBIE has confirmed that the proposed exemption for students can be implemented by
Immigration New Zealand (INZ) within urgent timeframes. This relies on:

e NZQA providing a list of named students to INZ, with appropriate details to confirm
identity, who they approve as meeting the Health guidelines/criteria. INZ does not have the
capacity or capability to perform an audit or assurance role in relation to adequacy of
isolation measures for each student relating to COVID-19.

e The named list of approved students to be exempted from the restrictions can be updated
ona rolling basis, but names will be required 72 hours prior to any individual boarding a
flight to New Zealand.

e If there is a valid visa, students will still need to meet their visa conditions of having health
insurance and ability to pay for living costs. Education providers will be asked to act as a
sponsor (guarantor) as part of the NZQA managed process of health declarations, where
students are not able to meet this visa condition.

Â« If visas are expired or expiring, there is the ability for a student to apply for a short term
student visa to enable them to arrive in New Zealand and apply for their substantive
student visa onshore. This would require a Special Direction from the Minister of
Immigration, including the waiver of most application information to expedite this process,
which he has indicated he would be willing to do.
