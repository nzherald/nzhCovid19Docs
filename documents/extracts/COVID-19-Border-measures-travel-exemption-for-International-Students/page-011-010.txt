restrictions too soon are very high for public health. While secondary considerations to
health, the potential impacts on public confidence, our economy, and international
relationships must also be taken into account.

The global context is dynamic and uncertain

exemption today, in a month or in three months’ time. There is continued and increasing
uncertainty, particularly given developments in recent days, with the potential for further
countries to be declared places of concern and added to the border restrictions. The
situation is fluid and a considered decision needs to be taken whether — even if feasible — an
exemption should be progressed now.

25 Because the tertiary sector terms are time-sensitive, there is a limited window in which to
