Category implications

18. People travelling to New Zealand from areas in Category 1B have expectations to self-
isolate and register with Healthline, but do not have travel restrictions. This applies for
all passengers except flight crew, passengers transiting through New Zealand within 24
hours, and passengers who have only transited 1B countries.

13: The intent of Category 1B is to encourage people from areas where there are high rates
of COVID-19 travelling to New Zealand to undertake 2 weeks of self-isolation, or to not
to travel to New Zealand.

20. People travelling to New Zealand from areas in Category 2 are not expected to self-
isolate but to be aware of COVID-19 symptoms and call Healthline if they become
unwell. Category 2 does not have travel restrictions.

21. Expanding Category 2 allows clinicians to consider testing in a wider range of people
who present with symptoms that may be due to COVID-19. This would help to reduce
the chances that a case is missed in New Zealand.

Next steps

22. Further advice on the categorisation of areas of concern for border measures will be
included in the consideration of border measures at Cabinet on 16 March 2020.

23. Based on the emerging developments, officials are currently considering options for
potential changes to add emerging areas of concern to Categories 1B and 2.

24. The CVD Committee may wish to make a decision on changes now or defer
consideration to Cabinet on 16 March 2020, following further assessment by officials.
