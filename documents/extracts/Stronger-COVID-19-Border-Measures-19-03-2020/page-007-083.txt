Public health in the Pacific

16 While some areas in the Pacific have relatively strong border measures, the
are now confirmed cases overnight in multiple countries in the Pacific. This
makes the risk associated with temporary visa holders from these countries
territories similar to other parts of the world.

WA While there is currently no identified spread of cases from the Pacific, there
significant transit with New Zealand, which increases the risk of importing
COVID-19 to New Zealand. With confirmed cases, it would be inconsistent w
existing border measures if the Pacific was not moved into Category 1A fora
least transit, visitor and working holiday visas.

18 We therefore recommend raising the categorisation of specific Pacific Island
Category 1A, along with the rest of the world. This categorisation does not a
to citizens of the Realm, and case-by-case exceptions may be made.

Recommended measures

19 We recommend stronger border measures by bringing the rest of the world,
including the Pacific, into Category 1A:
