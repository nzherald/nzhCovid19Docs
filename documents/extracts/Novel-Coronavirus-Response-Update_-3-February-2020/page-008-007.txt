RESTRICTED

32. The Ministry of Health propose that the health criteria for modifying or lifting the travel
restrictions at a high level are:

e the evolving epidemiology of the outbreak in both Mainland China and globally

e any emerging evidence about the transmissibility of the virus

e any emerging evidence about the severity of illness from infection

e any new advice from the WHO on travel restrictions

e public health measures taken by other countries designed to limit the spread of the virus.

33. Alongside these criteria, the Ministry of Health recommend that Government also consider:

e qualitative information sources including clinical advice; local reporting and intelligence;
the situation in the Pacific region; WHO guidance; and decisions made by other countries;
and

e economic and social impact measures.

34. The health criteria should be paramount, but officials recommend that these secondary
measures also be included in the review matrix. A fully-fleshed review matrix will be
prepared tomorrow (4 February) for Ministerial consideration.

Other emerging issues
Implications for Pacific Island Citizens

35. The Cabinet minute [CAB-20-MIN-0015] formalised today included in the list of exemptions
“citizens of Pacific Island countries (to enable them to return to home countries)”.

36. We would not however, wish to inadvertently send an infected person back to their home
country. In order to avoid this risk, we would need to provide self-isolation facilities for 14
days to an indeterminate number of Pacific Island citizens.

37. Advice from officials on this issue has therefore evolved, to now favour a case-by-case
assessment rather than a blanket exemption for citizens of Pacific Island countries.
s6(a), s9(2)(9)(i)

38. Officials therefore recommend that we do not create a region wide exemption for Pacific
citizens at this stage, but that we remain open to consider any specific requests we may
receive from Pacific governments on a case by case basis.

39. If Ministers agree, the Cabinet minute will need to be amended.

40. Inthe meantime, Immigration NZ is not currently applying a blanket exemption for citizens
from Pacific Island countries who have left or transited through mainland China (which
means they are subject to turnaround). If there are specific requests from Pacific Island
Countries seeking exemptions for its citizens, agencies will provide further advice to
Ministers with Power to Act on this issue.

41. If Ministers with Power to Act require further formal advice on this matter, this can be
provided urgently tomorrow.
