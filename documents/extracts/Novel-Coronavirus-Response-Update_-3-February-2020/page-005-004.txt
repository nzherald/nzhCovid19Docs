province in China, particularly Wuhan.
Health update

7. The Ministry of Health is the lead agency for the response to novel coronavirus.

8. Internationally, numbers of infected individuals is growing, with 14,557 cases reported
globally. It is likely that these figures are underreported, as many people may be
asymptomatic or only experiencing mild symptoms. World Health Organisation data shows
that there have been 305 confirmed fatalities inside China, and one confirmed death
outside China. Transmission of the virus is increasing, with more states within China
confirming cases and more reports of secondary, human-to-human transmission, both in
China and in other countries. The virus has generally low mortality rate of 2-3%, but figures
suggest that around 20% of those afflicted will suffer a major illness.

9. Domestically, ESR has a test for the virus and is testing several samples daily. To date,
there have been no confirmed cases in New Zealand. The focus for New Zealand’s health
system is twofold:

e ensuring appropriate domestic public health measures are in place to support New
Zealanders and visitors in the event of cases in New Zealand; and
e supporting passenger clearance at the border.

10. Other countries, such as Australia, Samoa, Fiji, and Vietnam, are making similar decisions
based on World Health Organisation advice.

11. The Office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and the Ministry of Health have
now been tasked to provide a regular weekly update on the epidemiology of the
coronavirus, including any developments over that week. This update will be circulated to
Ministers with Power to Act and relevant portfolio Ministers every Friday, unless any urgent
developments occur. The Office of the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor will also
complete a regular review of research being published.

12. The Ministry of Health is working with other agencies to ensure consistent messages are
produced and disseminated across a broad range of channels. The advice focuses on:

e The level of risk that New Zealand faces, in the context of numbers of cases and
mortality rates;
e The government response activity underway, including the border control measures;
e Future planning for changes in the current situation; and
e Precautions that New Zealanders should take, both for individuals and agencies.
Implementation at the border

13. Implementation measures at the border have begun as of today. All passengers arriving in
New Zealand (approximately 45,000 daily) will now be manually screened and interacted
with by border staff. Automated processing (SmartGate) was switched off this afternoon.
Manual processing is required to allow border agencies to check: passengers that are
travelling with split tickets or dual passports, to determine their point of origin; passengers’
recent travel history; or any obvious health symptoms. Inspectors must interact with all
passengers to determine whether passengers present risks or not.
