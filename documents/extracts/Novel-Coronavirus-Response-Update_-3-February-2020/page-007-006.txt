Assisted departure planning

22. MFAT has received informal approval from the Chinese government for the New Zealand
assisted departure flight out of Wuhan with a window of 9.00pm to midnight, Tuesday 4
February (local time â€” NZ is 5 hours ahead) for this flight. This is expected to be
communicated formally today. The flight crew are pre-positioned in Hong Kong, and
preparations are being made for the aircraft to fly from New Zealand.

23. MFAT currently has 250 people on the manifest for the flight (out of a 277-passenger
capacity). These passengers hold New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Island, Timor-Leste,
Canada and British nationality. Other countries have experienced a 20 percent drop off
from their original manifests, so demand is expected to remain within capacity.

24. MFAT has a team on the ground in China planning for the flight, working closely with an
Australian team. Both countries will work together to support both the Australian and
New Zealand flights and will return on the New Zealand flight.

25. In addition to the flight planning, New Zealand Police are leading an inter-agency planning
group to prepare for the arrival of the flight in New Zealand and subsequent isolation of the
passengers.

Effort at Whangaparoa

26. Passengers will be quarantined at the naval training facility in Whangaparoa, north of
Auckland, for 14 days after arrival. All passengers are being individually profiled to identify
any high-risk individuals, and to determine their needs during the isolation period.
9(2)(a)

27. Because the accommodation at Whangaparoa is shared, which is not suitable for medical
isolation, a large number of camper vans (RVs) have been secured to provide
accommodation.

28. The planning team is making arrangements for entertainment and hobby facilities to be
available at Whangaparoa to provide a positive environment for the passengers. Agencies
have been asked to provide resources to the Ministry of Health to support the requirements
of the operation, which will need to be staffed 24/7.

48-hour review period

29. Every 48 hours, the Ministry of Health will prepare advice for you on whether to retain the
border closure measures.

30. The Ministry's initial assessment is that health criteria for reassessing travel restrictions
should take a pre-emptive and conservative approach while our understanding of the
disease spread continues to evolve.

31. The criteria outlined below err on the side of caution. Alongside the 48-hour travel
restrictions review, the Ministry of Health propose that the criteria themselves are reviewed
regularly to ensure that New Zealand is not out of step with other countries.
