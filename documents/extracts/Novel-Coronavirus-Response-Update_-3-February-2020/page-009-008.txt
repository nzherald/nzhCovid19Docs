Longer-Term Issues
42. Agencies are considering a number of longer-term issues that flow from the decision to
close the border. These include:

e Whether to provide official guidance to New Zealand Ministers and officials about travelling
overseas from New Zealand for international meetings and visits. [Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Health]

e Any implications for fuel and fast moving consumer goods supply chain management, and
measures that may be required to address shortages of supply (there are existing national
mechanisms in place for these situations). [National Emergency Management Agency and
Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment].

e Options for stimulating demand in other tourism markets in the short-medium term, and
preparing for reactivating the Chinese tourism market when the public health situation
improves and travel restrictions are lifted. This includes considering the implications that
may arise from Chinese airlines pulling out of New Zealand routes in the short-term — both
in terms of Chinese nationals being able to return home in the short-term, but also
implications that could arise should those airlines not return to the New Zealand market in
the same way in the future. Any reduction in services would have a significant impact on
the tourism and international education sectors. [Tourism NZ].

e The trade and economic impacts on the New Zealand education industry (in particular
tertiary education), which has thousands of Chinese students due to arrive to start courses
in the next few weeks. [Education NZ].

e Any impacts the border closure is having on xenophobia and racist behaviour in New
Zealand (including online), including liaison with Chinese communities. [Ministry of Health,
Office of Ethnic Communities, NZ Police].

Decisions required from Ministers
43. Minister will be required to provide decisions or advice on:

a) Health matrix review (paragraph 35 refers). If Ministers have any particular questions
or issues they would wish to see canvassed in the advice being prepared for tomorrow,
please advise.

b) Approach to Pacific Island Citizens (refer paragraph 36 — 39); any initial reaction from
Ministers to this issue would be appreciated along with advice as to whether a further
submission to Ministers with Power to Act is required.

Consultation
44. The following agencies provided material to support the drafting of this briefing during the

Watch Group and independently afterwards. Given time constraints, we were unable to

consult agencies on the final version:

e The Ministries of: Health, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Education, Primary Industries,
Business, Innovation, and Employment, Social Development, Defence, Transport, Pacific
Peoples, and the Department of Internal Affairs
