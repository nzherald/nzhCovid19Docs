RESTRICTED

14. At the time of writing, a number of passengers (across four flights) checked in before
midnight, and so received clearance to travel on flights departing after midnight when the
closure came into effect. Immigration NZ advises there are approximately 11 passengers
who will not be allowed entry to New Zealand and will have processes in place to manage
them.

15. Manual processing will have an impact on passenger clearance times. To try to mitigate
these impacts, border agencies are using social media channels to alert travellers to the
changes in border requirements. Agencies are also actively sharing public health
information through passenger channels (such as airline and travel companies, diplomatic
posts, industry associations and accommodation providers, ) as well as using health advice
cards, posters, banners and, where available, electronic signage at the airport.

16. Manual processing will also have an impact on border agency resources, with additional
staff being called to duty and other staff being diverted from any other non-essential work
for the time being.

17. Work is also underway to develop daily reporting to Ministers on: volumes of passengers
turned away, volumes of passengers moving through manual screening, screening delay
time due to e-gate closures, numbers of passengers identified as meeting criteria for non-
entry, numbers of additional staff required to implement these measures. It is anticipated
that this daily reporting will be available from tomorrow (4 February).

18. There have been some operational issues raised today, particularly at offshore locations
(enquiries being made of Embassy’s and Consulates) around definitional issues particularly
relating to “immediate family” and “partner”. These have been clarified operationally in the
course of the day, and reflect the fact that we are still within the first 24 hours of
implementation. It is likely further definitional issues might arise, but relevant agencies are
communicating with each other well and resolution is occurring. Any matters requiring
Ministerial decision will be referred.

19. Border Sector agencies are developing options for dealing with staff who may be exposed
to / or infected by the virus while at work. This includes thinking about wider impacts of
staffing shifts.

Issues requiring further consideration

20. Some further Ministerial decisions will be required to fully implement the border closure, for
example, the Minister of Immigration has today sought your approval to make urgent
changes to the Immigration (Carriers’ Information Obligations) Regulations 2010 in order
to implement the border closure decisions made.

21. Agencies are assessing whether any additional decisions or powers might be required. For
example:

a) MFAT is considering whether exemptions might be required for visiting diplomatic and
official delegations travelling to New Zealand, where it is in New Zealand’s national
interest for them to travel. For example, a Chinese delegation is scheduled to come to
New Zealand next week for China-NZ Free Trade Agreement negotiations. Further
advice will be provided on this in due course, and will include health advice.

b) Airline passengers will not be the only ones affected. Maritime arrivals (in particular,
cruise ships but also cargo vessels and other craft) will also be impacted. Officials are
