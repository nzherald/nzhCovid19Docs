Financial Support for New Zealanders Temporarily Overseas or

Domiciled in Australia who are in Financial Distress due to the COVID-

19 Pandemic

The group of Ministers with Power to Act on COVID-19 matters [CAB-20-MIN-0130] convened

on 3 April 2020 at 10.30am, and in accordance with their Power to Act:

1 noted that travel restrictions resulting from the global COVID-19 response mean a high
likelihood of travelling New Zealanders being stranded offshore, who may lack access to
financial or other resources to support themselves, with consequent health and welfare risks

2 noted that MFAT consular advice is that New Zealanders who are not able to return home
should take steps to ensure their safety in place, and contact their travel insurer, bank, family
and friends in the first instance if they are facing financial difficulties

3 agreed that stranded New Zealanders overseas should continue to follow the advice above,
with consular support available including the possibility of an emergency loan |59(2)(g)(ii)

4 noted that in the current circumstances, MFAT consular officials are taking a more flexible
approach to the provision of financial support, so that individuals are not prevented from
returning to New Zealand quickly or sheltering safely in place by e.g. securing appropriate
accommodation or health services

5 noted that on 23 March 2020, the Prime Minister issued an Epidemic Notice, which took
effect on 25 March 2020 and enables the use of special welfare powers under the Social
Security Act 2018

6 noted that Epidemic Management Notices issued with the written approval of Ministers
have provided further tools for the delivery of financial assistance to stranded migrants,
including broad emergency powers under the Social Security Act 2018

7 agreed that the following payment arrangements be made for MSD clients stranded
overseas:

7.1 payments of New Zealand Superannuation and Veterans Pension can be resumed
from the date a person expected to return to New Zealand, with the flexibility to
resume payments from an earlier date for people in severe hardship or not to resume
payments where it is identified that people no longer qualify;
