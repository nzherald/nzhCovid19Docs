ONGOING CONSULAR ADVICE TO NEW ZEALANDERS IN CHINA

Key points

® On 31 January 2020 a decision was made to charter a flight to assist
New Zealanders and their families to depart from Wuhan, Hubei province.
Wuhan is the centre of the novel coronavirus outbreak, and travel restrictions
mean New Zealanders cannot leave the city or province via commercial means.

& A significant number of New Zealanders will still be in China following the
departure of the charter flight which is due to depart Wuhan on 5 February. As
at 4 February there are 187 New Zealanders registered on SafeTravel as being
in Wuhan, Hubei Province and 1385 in total in mainland China.

e In view of the number of New Zealanders remaining in China, our SafeTravel
website will also include some practical steps that people can take to deal with
the current situation based on Ministry of Health advice.

® On SafeTravel we are advising New Zealanders to depart China at the earliest
opportunity and recommend that they contact the airlines directly for
information. A number of airlines have cancelled or reduced flights to and from
China but commercial flights are still operating from airports other than Wuhan.

® There are, however, some difficulties around this, as many flights to
New Zealand transit through other countries, notably Australia, which has
imposed border restrictions on foreign nationals arriving from China. New
Zealanders travelling home from China will not be able to transit via Australia
unless they are dual citizens, permanent residents or they usually reside in
Australia.
