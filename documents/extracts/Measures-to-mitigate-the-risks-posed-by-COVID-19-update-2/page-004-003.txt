Epidemic Management

19 On 26 March 2020 you will be provided a briefing on Epidemic Management Notices
(B4008). This will at the same time go to the Prime Minister and Minister of
Justice. Briefing B4008 will be seeking two Epidemic Management Notices. Epidemic
Management Notices enable dormant provisions in specific enactments to be activated
and prospective modification orders to be activated. In this case, the Ministry of Justice
and Corrections will be requesting Epidemic Management Notices for the Parole Act 2002
and the Sentencing Act 2002.

20  Inrelation to the Parole Act, without this notice, from 11:59pm 25 March 2020, the Parole
Board is unable to make decisions. The notice will enable:
. Decisions made on paper (rather than in person hearings)
e The chairperson or panel convenor able to act alone
e A probation officer to vary release conditions of an offender if the probation officer

has already made an application to the Board

21 At this stage we are not seeking the following powers but may at a later stage if they are

required
