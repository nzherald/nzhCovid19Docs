27 Corrections has two key projects which underpin our ability to deliver essential services in
the short term. These are: .

e Modular Build Programme: This programme is essential to the ability to accommodate
the expected level of the male prison population later this year and the first 360 beds
are 90% complete.

e Arohata 60 bed accommodation unit: This project is essential to the ability to
accommodate the expected level of the female prison population later this year and is
90% complete. -

28 These two projects provide critical capacit contributions both in the context of expected
demand for prisoner accommodation SIQI0)

e These projects represent a critical means of improving the practical ability to manage
isolation and quarantine requirements in the entire prison network, especially ina —
situation where there is an outbreak of Covid19 in the prisoner population.

29 Our contractors delivering these projects have confirmed that they will put in place
alternative ways of working to keep employees safe, including shift-based working,
staggered meal breaks, flexible leave arrangements and physical distancing. Corrections
fully supports these measures, and we expect to see them implemented effectively.
Corrections is in discussions with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment
regarding the continuance of these two critical projects.

30 A pause has been put in place for the Waikeria Prison Development. This is a
strategically important project that will help address overcrowding in the male high security
area of the prison network. However, in the context of the risks and business continuity
considerations of Corrections’ essential services at this time, this project is not essential
and can be paused.
