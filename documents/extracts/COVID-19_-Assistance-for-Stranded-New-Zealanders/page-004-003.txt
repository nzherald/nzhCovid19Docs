COVID-19: Assistance for Stranded New Zealanders
Recommendations
It is recommended that you:
1 Note that the Ministry will continue to update consular advice as Yes/No
circumstances dictate;
2 Note that in most circumstances New Zealanders unable to get Yes / No
home on commercial flights will need to remain where they are for
an extended period of time;
3 Agree that officials should explore options for providing financial Yes/No
support to stranded New Zealanders including:
a. Increasing the size of MFATâ€™s emergency travel funding, and
provide easier access to this funding including through
increased publicity;
b. Exploring options with commercial banks to increase credit card
limits and/or ease repayment conditions;
c. Exploring options with the Ministry of Social Development to
increase access to financial support for New Zealanders
overseas, including pensioners;
4 S9(2)(b) (ii), $9(2)(ba) Yes / No
5 Agree that where assisted departure in conjunction with other Yes/No
countries or on our own may appear feasible, officials apply the
criteria in paragraph 28 in preparing advice to Ministers
[Please note: this recommendation should reference
the criteria in paragraph 30, not paragraph 28. ]

Minister of Foreign Affairs
