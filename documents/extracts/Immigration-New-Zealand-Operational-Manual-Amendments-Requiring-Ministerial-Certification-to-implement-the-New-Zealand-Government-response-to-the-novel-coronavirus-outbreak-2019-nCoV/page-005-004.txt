b. Immigration officers will exercise specific powers under section 97 of the Act to deny
the boarding of any travellers subject to the temporary border control measures onto
any aircraft before it leaves for New Zealand.

c. For those travellers who have been refused entry permission but are required to
stay in New Zealand (such as those who may be subject to quarantine or are unable
to return to mainland China as commercial services are unable to take them) will be
subject to turnaround under section 115 of the Act. This allows an immigration
Officer to let the traveller into New Zealand, subject to residence and reporting
requirements (such as residing at a specific place, under section 315 of the Act).

Special direction for those on New Zealand Government-chartered

flight from Wuhan

Sa ee eS SS eer

7. The New Zealand Government has chartered a flight to assist the departure of people from
Wuhan province in China, in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The flight is
scheduled to depart China in the coming days.

8. Although most passengers will be New Zealand citizens or resident visa holders, some non-
visa holders, including those from the Pacific, may also be on board. To assist the departure
and arrival of those who are travelling on the flight, a special direction is required to waive the
requirement to hold a visa or electronic travel authority permitting travel to New Zealand. A
visa will be granted on arrival for those who do not already have a valid New Zealand visa.

9. The special direction is limited to those approved for the flight by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade. It is also limited to those travelling on the New Zealand Government-
chartered flight departing before 10 February. This date allows for some uncertainty
regarding the exact departure date of the flight.
