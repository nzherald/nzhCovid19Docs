Background

1; Following Cabinet agreement, the Prime Minister has announced a range of short term
changes to New Zealandâ€™s border settings in response to risks arising from the novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. These changes include amendments to Border Entry
instructions which regulate entry permission.

2. The response outlined in this briefing is similar to the response of the Australian Border
Force, who have announced that they will deny entry to anyone who has left mainland China
from 1 February, with the exception of Australian citizens, permanent residents, and
immediate family members of Australian citizens and permanent residents.

Amendment to Border Entry instructions

Proposed new immigration instructions

3. The proposed immigration instructions contained in Appendix 1 state that entry permission
must be denied to people who have been in, or transited through, mainland China between 3
February and midnight 16 February 2020. People excluded from this provision include:

a. New Zealand citizens

b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders

c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder

d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand

e. People covered by regulation 25 of the Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and
Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the Regulations). This includes a number of
groups such as cruise ship passengers and marine and aircraft crew who hold an
ETA, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific expedition under the
auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.

4. The proposed immigration instructions are applicable until 11:59 pm on 16 February 2020.
This time-limited approach is consistent with the developing nature of the outbreak and the
international response. Further immigration instructions will be provided for certification if this
response needs to be extended beyond 16 February.

5, Cruise ship passengers and marine and aircraft crew cannot be refused entry permission by
operation of the Regulations, and those persons are deemed to hold a visa and have been
granted entry permission on arrival in New Zealand. That said, it is possible to suspend their
visa waiver status at any point between embarkation onto the craft and arrival in New
Zealand. If a carrier informs INZ that a person boarding a craft has or suspected of having
the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), it is possible to suspend their visa waiver status at any
point up until their arrival in New Zealand which means the person has no legal basis to
apply for entry permission or a visa on arrival. It is also possible to revoke their entry
permission and cancel their visa on arrival.

Other responses to implement the temporary border control measure

6. | Anumber of other mechanisms will also contribute to the response:

a. All travellers (including those exempt from the border closure) arriving out of
mainland China will be asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time
they leave mainland China.
