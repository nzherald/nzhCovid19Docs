biosecurity. MPI will be minimising physical contact with these passengers. Biosecurity

staff can largely search their luggage manually or by X-ray without the passengers being

present. Where human contact is required and should the Ministry of Health general risk
assessment and advice warrant it, we may alter our methods for engaging with
passengers. MPI is also giving consideration to the sea border and clearing commercial
shipping vessels with crews from mainland China. MPI envisages a similar approach, that

is minimising personal contact.

16. Based on our understanding of current Australian border health measures, it is proposed
that our measures will be the same:

° flights will continue to be met from mainland China

° in addition to the current measures, health staff will require passengers to self-
isolate for fourteen days. Passengers will be given information about what self-
isolation means ie no return to work or school, no attending social functions or
mass gatherings, but freely able to continue daily activities within their home
environment.

° passengers will be given a thermometer and asked to monitor their temperature
daily. They will be advised to phone the public health unit if their temperature
becomes elevated (38C or higher).

° passengers who may be taking internal flights will be provided with a mask and
advice on how to wear and dispose of it.

° any passenger with an elevated temperature will be managed according to the ill
traveller protocol.

17. For passengers who are not able to self-isolate at home, isolation facilities may be
required. Public health units have advanced planning on the provision of isolation
facilities and we will check whether there are facilities immediately available for
individuals and families, if required.
