consideration to prioritising the renewal of some documents (eg heavy vehicle
CoFs) ahead of other vehicles based on any safety risks.

47 This provides for an orderly return to compliance and reduces the likelihood of
compliance bottlenecks at agencies and inspecting organisations.

48 | note that there is considerable uncertainty around both the likely duration of
higher levels of alert for COVID-19 and of the capacity for organisations to
manage the transition back to compliance. Unless the issues arising require
Cabinet's attention, | propose that adjustments to the expiry dates in the Rule
can be made by me through Ministerial rule making processes, without further
reference to Cabinet. | do not anticipate needing to amend the Regulation at
this time. It only deals with vehicle licensing and this is a simple matter to
bring back into compliance.

Financial Implications

52 There are no additional financial implications to this proposal for the Crown.

53: Because vehicle licensing is continuous®, the licence expiry date will not be
altered by the extension, even if the vehicle was not being used during AL4.
This means owners will still need to pay for their licence including for the
period of the extension, but do not need make the payment (or display an up-
to-date label) during the period of AL4. For example, if a person’s annual
vehicle licence expired in March 2020, and services resumed in April 2020,

5 It is an offence to operate a vehicle without a valid RUC licence and this has a fine of up to $1,000.

Continuous licensing means that vehicles are licensed from and too a specific date, usually annual.

These dates remain constant regardless of when the fee is paid.
