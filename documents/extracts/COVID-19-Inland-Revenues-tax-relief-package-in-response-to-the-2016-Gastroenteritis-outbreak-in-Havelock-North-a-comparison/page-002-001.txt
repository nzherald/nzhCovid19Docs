COVID-19: Inland Revenue’s tax relief package in response to the 2016

Gastroenteritis outbreak in Havelock North — a comparison

Purpose

ue This report specifically provides information on Inland Revenue’s response to the
Hawke’s Bay gastro outbreak in 2016 (the Hawke’s Bay emergency event) and how
this compares to Inland Revenue’s current COVID-19 outbreak response .

2. Officials have been directed to look at a provisional tax relief package for COVID-
19 based on the Hawke's Bay gastroenteritis outbreak and how this response would
work on a nationwide basis. This direction has been given by the PMBAC, at a
meeting held on 5 March 2020, and advised to officials by email.

3: This report follows our earlier reports IR2020/088, dated 17 February 2020; and
IR2020/123 dated 5 March 2020.

Hawke’s Bay emergency event (2016)

4. In August 2016, approximately 28 percent of the population in Havelock North was
affected by gastroenteritis through the contamination of its water supply. Given
the number of individuals affected, Inland Revenue considered the event was an
emergency event under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. This
was based on Ministry of Health advice that the level of infection would have an
impact on the ability of small businesses to meet their upcoming tax obligations.

Ds. The table on page illustrates Inland Revenue’s response to the Hawke’s Bay
emergency event and how Inland Revenue’s current response to the coronavirus
COVID-19 outbreak compares. The main difference is relief from use of money
interest (UOMI) has not been actioned as the current state for COVID-19 is not yet,
in our assessment as at 6 March 2020, an emergency event.

Overview of taxpayer relief responses to the Hawke’s Bay gastro outbreak and

COVID-19

6. The range of tax relief options deployed for the Hawke’s Bay event included
remission of late payment and late filing penalties, instalment arrangements, and
remission of use of money interest. An Order in Council was approved and
authorised Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest in this case.

Te The tax relief provided for that emergency event did not remove the obligation on
taxpayers to pay tax or alter payment dates, but reduced the tax penalties and
interest costs if the tax was not paid on time. The relief applied for a period of
about six weeks (from late August 2016 to 30 September 2016). As such the
response did not directly affect the operation of the provisional tax rules.

8. The range of tax relief options used for the Hawke’s Bay emergency event, with the
exception of use of money interest relief, have already been deployed for COVID-
19 and includes remission of late payment and late filing penalties, and instalment
arrangements for tax debts. These have been made available to taxpayers from
14 February 2020 under Inland Revenue discretionary hardship relief rules.
