Reducing the rate of UOMI

16. In our report on 5 March 2020 we noted that officials were working on a tax policy
response looking at cutting the current rate of UOMI on underpayment of tax, which
is currently 8.35%.

17. A tax policy work programme project looking at the formula that is used to set the
rate of UOMI has been brought forward as part of Inland Revenue’s COVID-19
response. The purpose of any reduction in the interest rate applied to
underpayments of tax is to reduce the carrying cost of tax debt and reduce the
financial penalty associated with under-estimating provisional tax liabilities.

18. We will report to you on the outcome of this work in the week beginning 9 March
2020.

UOMI relief offered by the tax pooling companies

19: As noted in our earlier report, we are aware the tax pooling companies are assisting
business taxpayers affected by cash flow constraints created by the economic
effects of the COVID-19 outbreak by offering competitive interest rates for
taxpayers needing to use their services to meet provisional tax payments.
