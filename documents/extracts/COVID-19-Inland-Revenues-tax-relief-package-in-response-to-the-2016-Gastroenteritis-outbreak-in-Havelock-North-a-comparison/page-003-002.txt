Use of money interest (UOMI) remission

9. Relief from interest on outstanding tax debts (“use of money interest”) is not yet,
in our view, appropriate for the COVID-19 situation. This is because the statutory
criteria under the Tax Administration Act 1994 have not yet been met.

10. UOMI is designed to compensate the government for the loss of use of money from
taxpayers paying too little tax.

11. The Tax Administration Act provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue
to remit this interest where:

11.1. an emergency event physically prevents a taxpayer from paying tax on time;

11.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of interest; and

11.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of
interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such
a class of persons.

12. The key criterion for classification as an emergency event relates to a taxpayer
being physically prevented from making a payment on or before the due date under
the Inland Revenue Acts.

13. An emergency event, for the purposes of the Civil Defence Emergency Act 2002, is
framed in the context where the event — for example, a plague or epidemic, has the
potential to cause loss of life or injury or illness that endangers the safety of the
public or property in New Zealand. :

14. If the consequences of the COViD-19 outbreak begin presenting an immediate risk
to New Zealanders’ public health, the event would be considered to meet the
statutory requirement as an “emergency event”. Officials would recommend
preparing an Order in Council to remove interest charges from taxpayer debts for
areas that are specifically affected.

15. In our view, there are tax compliance and integrity risks with applying this relief on
a nationwide scale. The relief should be reserved for situations when there is a
need, such as direction from the Ministry of Health, to restrict or otherwise limit the
movement of individuals for public health safety reasons in a particular area. The
