23 Under normal circumstances, New Zealanders travelling overseas are expected to have
sufficient funds and to take out travel insurance. The global COVID-19 pandemic has,
however, led many insurers to invoke force majeure clauses leaving a number of travellers
without insurance cover. While we expect most of these people will be able to meet the
additional costs of remaining in country, some will struggle if they are forced to remain
overseas for a prolonged period of time.

24 Officials will monitor this situation and will provide advice on additional interventions if this is
needed at a later date $9(2)(Q)(i), s9(2)(f)(iv) s9(2)(f)(iv)

a As at 29 March, MFAT currently has 23,331 New
Zealanders registered on SafeTravel but this is only a portion of the number of New
Zealanders offshore. 6,369 individuals or tours are registered as “travelling” or on a cruise
(the remaining 16,962 are registered as “residing” in the country they are in). However, pre-
COVID-19 estimates were that there were around 80,000 New Zealanders travelling offshore
on a short-term basis and some 800,000 residing offshore. These numbers are likely to have
reduced significantly, as many New Zealanders have made their way home in recent weeks.
On 25 March 2020, there were 1,456 active consular cases in 57 countries of which 90
percent relate to New Zealanders experiencing difficulties returning home.
