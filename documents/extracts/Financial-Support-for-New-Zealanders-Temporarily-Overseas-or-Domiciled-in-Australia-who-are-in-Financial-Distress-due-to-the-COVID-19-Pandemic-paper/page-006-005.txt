New Zealanders domiciled in Australia

30 The New Zealand diaspora in Australia is distinct because of its size (approximately 650,000
people), the fact that most New Zealanders in Australia have settled there permanently, and
because of the highly variable access they have to Australian social security support.

31 In avery welcome development this week, Australia included New Zealanders employed in
Australia in its COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme, which will provide eligible workers with
A$1500 gross per fortnight for up to six months. Officials are still assessing the impact of that
decision, though it seems likely to help significant numbers of New Zealand workers. Australia
has also allowed New Zealanders to access a portion of their Australian superannuation
savings (up to A$20,000 over two financial years) if they are facing financial hardship due to
COVID-19.

32 It remains likely that some New Zealanders in Australia will lose work due to COVID-19, for
example if their companies are ineligible for the subsidy, or choose to reduce staff regardless,
or if their work does not qualify for other reasons. Many such New Zealanders are unable to
access Australia’s main unemployment or sickness benefit (the Jobseeker Payment), due to
their Australian immigration status. Australians in New Zealand are eligible for such benefits
after a two-year stand-down period.

Ministers and officials are
engaging extensively with Australian counterparts to make this argument.

35 At present, access to Australian social security support for the estimated 650,000 New
Zealanders in Australia varies considerably:

e Approximately 200,000 arrived in Australia before February 2001, are classed as
“protected” Special Category Visa holders, and have the full social security
entitlements available to Australian permanent residents.

e An estimated 200,000-220,000 New Zealanders arrived after February 2001 but have
lived in Australia for 10 years or more. Unless they have done so before, New
Zealanders in this group are entitled to a once-only payment of Australia’s main
unemployment or sickness benefit (the Jobseeker Payment) for up to six months.

e A further estimated 200,000-220,000 New Zealanders (who arrived after 2001 but
have lived in Australia for fewer than 10 years) have no access to Australian social
security support at present. Aside from early access to any Australian superannuation
savings, the modest support they are eligible for is not likely to be adequate to cover
the cost of day-to-day living during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some members of this
group may receive New Zealand Superannuation or disability support payments.
