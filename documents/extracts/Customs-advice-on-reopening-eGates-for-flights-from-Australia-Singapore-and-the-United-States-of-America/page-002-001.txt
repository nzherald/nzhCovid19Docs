Manual processing has led to expected delays at airports

e The 2 February 2020, decision to close eGate processing to all passengers arriving in
New Zealand led to some expected delays at airports as a larger proportion of
passengers than usual are being processed manually.

e Delays are being managed for the time being through the rostering on of additional staff;
however this will become less sustainable in the longer term.

e On 3 February 2020, 21,725 arriving passengers were processed and on 4 February
2020 this number was 18,686. Under normal circumstances approximately 65% of these
passengers would be processed through eGates.

Operation of reopening eGates â€” further information

e The eGate software does not allow flight-specific processing. This means that when
flights are arriving from multiple countries at once, officers will have to monitor eGate
entrances to ensure that only passengers arriving from Australia, Singapore and the
United States of America are allowed through to the eGates.

e This is expected to result in slight delays at eGate than normal but will be quicker than
manual processing. Ministry of Primary Industries officers will be available to assist.

We will continue to review eGate access and operations
We are continuing to review access to eGate processing for passengers from all countries and,
if necessary, will modify eligibility if the situation changes.
