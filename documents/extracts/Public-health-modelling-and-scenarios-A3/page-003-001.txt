Some jurisdictions, eg Singapore and Taiwan, have successfully prevented widespread outbreaks.
“We want to be Taiwan, not Italy” Number of days since first case
Government can apply various public health measures at each outbreak phase to slow the spread of the virus, ie “going hard”:
e Ensure isolation and effective treatment of the confirmed case; initiate immediate containment measures for the confirmed case — contact tracing and contact management
* “ ¢ Apply quarantine and containment measures for close contacts of the confirmed case — eg quarantine family members, apply containment protocols for aged care facility
First cases or sporadic i ‘ = a
auaas Increase surveillance and testing as part of increased efforts to actively find cases
* Promote basic hygiene messages and infection prevention and control in the community through mass media campaigns, including highlighting the importance of hand washing and cough etiquette
@ Promote seeking phone advice (Healthline or GP) before presenting at General Practice, after hours clinics or Emergency Departments
 — Investigate and understand the cluster and then apply response measures— eg
(1) if all cases are associated with international travel, border restrictions might be reviewed;
(2) a cluster associated with a facility (eg hospital, aged care facility, hotel, school, place of worship) could lead to restrictions being placed on that facility and quarantining/isolating of individuals concerned;
(3) a cluster associated with an event (eg participants at an event subsequently disperse) would lead to contact tracing;
(4) cases in a particular settlement (eg small town) could lead to measures to control spread such as restrictions on travel outside the affected area
* Consider advising the cancellation of mass gatherings (eg sports events, festivals, camps, concerts, conferences, religious and public events) and consider advising the closure of public venues in relevant areas
‘© Encourage employers to consider alternative ways of working (eg remote working, shift-based working, social distancing, physical distancing within the workplace, staggering meal breaks, flexible leave arrangements)
Malifple casters Promote social distancing and consider restricting mass gatherings and closing public venues in affected areas
P * Consider the feasibility and effectiveness of placing restrictions on affected areas and/or protecting unaffected areas (eg forbid people from an infected place entering a healthy district; forbid people from leaving a healthy area)
© = Consider activating community-based assessment centres as appropriate
© Consider added legislative measures, eg special powers under the Health Act and Epidemic Preparedness Act to allow more enforceable powers (eg can require cancellation of mass gatherings (includes educational facilities), could
require workplaces to close, issue travel advisories, impose internal travel restrictions (eg if transmission is mostly limited to particular locations), or impose restrictions on public transport)
— . © Consider declaring a state of local or national emergency under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002
a awannaeien © Review border restrictions: eg could lift import restrictions, but might consider exit measures (eg prevent infected from travelling, require 14-day quarantine before allowing departure to the Pacific)
ee eatransiss'on. © Consider advising people at high-risk (eg older people, those with co-morbidities) to remain at home
© Activate community-based assessment centres, as appropriate, to triage people in order to minimise pressure on healthcare facilities and services
© DHBs defer elective procedures and reprioritise healthcare staff
e Remove travel restrictions, except exit measures at the border
