Background

Temporary border control measures

1. On 1 February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealandâ€™s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.

2. The current temporary border measures deny entry permission to any person who has:

a. been present in or transited through mainland China or Iran within 14 days prior to
boarding

b. been present on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and attempts to travel to New
Zealand within 14 days of disembarking from the cruise ship.

3. On 14 March 2020, Cabinet, agreed to extend the temporary border measures for a further
14 days until 31 March 2020. Cabinet also agreed to remove the Diamond Princess cruise
ship from the temporary border measures.

4. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control
measures:

a. New Zealand citizens

b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders

c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder

d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand

e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrival by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers
(who travel to New Zealand as part of a scheduled cruise) and marine and aircraft
crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific expedition under the
auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.
