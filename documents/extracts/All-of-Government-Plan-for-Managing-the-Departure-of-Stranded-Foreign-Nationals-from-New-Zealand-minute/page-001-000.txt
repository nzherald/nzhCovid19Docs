All of Government Plan for Managing the Departure of Stranded Foreign

Nationals from New Zealand

The group of Ministers with Power to Act on COVID-19 matters [CAB-20-MIN-0130] convened

on 2 April 2020 at 10.30am, and in accordance with their Power to Act:

Background

1 noted that there are a significant number of stranded foreign nationals in New Zealand,
placing additional strain on infrastructure and critical support services;

2 noted that the current land-based and domestic flight restrictions provide a significant
limitation on the ability of stranded foreign nationals to catch international flights out of
New Zealand;

Ground transportation to Auckland and Christchurch Airports

3 noted that a significant number of stranded foreign nationals are within ground travel
distance of Auckland or Christchurch Airports;

4 agreed that land-based travel to these airports, by a stranded foreign national with a ticket
on an international flight (whether scheduled commercial or, if approved, charter) that is
departing from within the city they are in or near, be considered an essential journey for the
purposes of the COVID-19 Alert Level system;

5 agreed that in classifying these as an essential journey, these stranded foreign nationals can
travel to an airport via private transport, taxis or rideshare services, public transport, or
dedicated charter buses, subject to applicable requirements and health guidelines;

Domestic air travel of stranded foreign nationals to Auckland and Christchurch

Airports

6 noted that a number of stranded foreign nationals are in the regions and will still not be able
to reach Auckland or Christchurch Airports through the approach agreed to above;
