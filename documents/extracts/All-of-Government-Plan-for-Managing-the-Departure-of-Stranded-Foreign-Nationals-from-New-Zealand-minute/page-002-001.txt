7 agreed that stranded foreign nationals be permitted to travel to an airport and board a
domestic transit flight (scheduled commercial or, if agreed, charter) to Auckland or
Christchurch airports in order to connect with international flights, subject to all relevant
COVID-19 Alert Level health conditions, and so long as they have a ticket booked for an
international flight schedule to depart no more than 24 hours from the departure of their
connecting domestic transit flight;

Land-based transport to domestic airports

8 noted that extending the ability to take land-based transport to the five domestic transit
airports operating (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Nelson) would allow
all but a very few stranded foreign nationals to access international flights;

9 agreed that a transit corridor be permitted for stranded foreign nationals;

Qatar Airways: moving to twice daily flights

10 noted that Qatar Airways has requested that the New Zealand Government allow it to move
from daily to twice daily flights between Doha and Auckland;

11 noted that no other airlines are currently flying between the Middle East/Europe and New
Zealand, and that these extra flights would provide a valuable means for European nationals
here to be evacuated and for New Zealanders stranded in Europe to return home;

12 noted that these flights, depending on how many New Zealanders took them to come home,
could place strain on the system of transitioning New Zealanders back into the country
(including via managed self-isolation) during Alert Level 4;

13 agreed to Qatar Airwaysâ€™ request to move to twice daily flights;

Foreign government assisted charter flights

14 noted that initial feedback from 25 diplomatic missions suggests there are around 35,000
foreign nationals who would leave if they could access enhanced means of doing so on
scheduled commercial or foreign government assisted charter flights;

15 agreed that the current moratorium on foreign government assisted departure flights be
lifted, with the tempo and capacity of such flights to be actively managed, commensurate
with COVID-19 Alert Level 4 and processes for managing the safe return of
New Zealanders into self-isolation and, as necessary, quarantine;

16 noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be responsible for leading
negotiations with foreign governments on these government assisted departure flights;
