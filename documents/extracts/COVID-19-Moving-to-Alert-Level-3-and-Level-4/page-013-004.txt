69 But regulators cannot do this on their own. The only realistic way to ensure a
comprehensive response is to involve leadership beyond Government. For this
to work, you will need to engage key stakeholders, including industry leaders,
unions, and community leaders to get the country behind this approach. The
public sector can lead by example and provide critical mass.

70 To be sustainable over the medium term without relying on coercive
enforcement, this will need community-endorsed compliance, with widespread
buy-in that this is the right thing for everyone to do, including to monitor and self-
enforce, and to support people within their community.

rf) This would need to be backed with strong communications and clear guidance,
with simple and certain expectations, key messaging of those expectations
through wide-spread communication, and supporting information products.

2 Ultimately, however, this must be backed up by regulators who are willing and
able to enforce using strong sanctions. This is not a space that all existing
regulators currently operate in, and some may require clear direction to do so.

73 To achieve consistency both in relation to compliance strategies (inform, help but
also sanction) and communications, officials are developing a standard operating
model which can be a touchstone for individual regulators, tailored to this
context.

75 Delivery will require coordinated action across a range of departments.

76 This is being managed through the COVID-19 Operations Command Centre,
which was set up on 20 March, as a part of the NCMC framework. The
Operational Command Centre is the mechanism that will enable the governance
of the operational response and provide assurance to Cabinet, and improve
operational interagency collaboration.
