compliance. We note that these countries established intensive levels of testing
and tracking early.

33 Experiences overseas demonstrate that there is no single approach that is
effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. A severe lockdown to reduce
physical contact managed to contain and control the spread in China.
Implementing extensive “track, trace and treat” measures have been effective in
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.

34 The common factors across successful approaches include:

34.1 the willingness to act quickly

34.2 ensuring the full implementation and high levels of public compliance

34.3 implementing a broad range of self-reinforcing measures (e.g. “track, trace
and treat” measures become more effective if self-isolation measures
reduce the number of contacts).

35: A study” based on data of China’s COVID-19 infections prior to 23 January found
that most COVID-19 infections were undocumented and unidentified because the
infected persons experienced no, or only mild, symptoms.

36 For Australia, the soft trigger for considering community transmission was the
first confirmed case without an international travel history. Two weeks later, they
saw a dramatic increase in cases. We are now at this same tipping point.

37 We consider New Zealand and Australia are good comparators due to similar
health and social systems. Our containment strategies to date have been similar
to those in Australia. If we look at the number of cases in New South Wales we
are near the same place they were on 11 March 2020. It appears we are ona
similar trajectory to New South Wales. If this continued we could have
approximately 350 cases in about 10 days time.
