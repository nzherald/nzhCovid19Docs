Brief: B20-0065

9. You announced the decision to allow industry to release rock lobster currently
held in holding pots, under the supervision of Fisheries Officers, subject to
biosecurity and survivability criteria [B20-0067 refers]. This process is
underway, and we will continue to update you on this.

Proposed ACE carry forward

10, 89@)(ba)G)

Should you decide to carry forward rock lobster
ACE, there are two options for enabling this:

Carrying forward up to 10% of the total ACE held by fishers

11. Section 67A of the Fisheries Act 1996 (the Act) provides that at the start of each
fishing year, individual ACE holders are provided with either:

a. Up to 10% of their total ACE holdings at the end of the previous fishing
year before catch balancing; or
b. |The amount of ACE which was not caught, whichever is the lesser.
12. However, section 67A does not apply if:
a. The fishstock is listed on Schedule 5A of the Act; or
b. _ If the specific stock has been subject to a TACC reduction from the
previous year.

13. All rock lobster ACE is listed on Schedule 5A of the Act, and is therefore exempt
from carry forward provisions. Other Schedule 5A stocks, where carry forward is
not permitted, include cockles, oysters, eels, pipi and scallops. At the time the
Schedule was developed it was considered there would be no need to manage
unexpected rock lobster catch at the end of the fishing year, due to the precise
nature of rock lobster harvesting. Under the Act, an Order in Council is required
to remove stocks from Schedule 5A.

Carrying forward all unfished ACE

14. Section 67A of the Act limits the proportion of ACE that can be carried forward
for a stock. Enabling the full amount (estimated by Fisheries New Zealand as
currently up to 22% in total) S9ยง@ea@ would require a legislative
amendment to remove or increase the 10% limit for rock lobster.
