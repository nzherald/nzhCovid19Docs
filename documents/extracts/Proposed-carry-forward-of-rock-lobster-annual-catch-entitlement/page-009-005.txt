Next Steps

21.Should you agree to our recommended approach, we will prepare you a draft

consultation document on options for carrying forward uncaught rock lobster ACE.

Media and Communications

22. There is likely to be a high level of public and media attention in relation to this
given links to the Coronavirus outbreak. Fisheries New Zealand is urgently
working to finalise internal and external communications, and will continue to
liaise closely with your office.

23. Weare also considering other means of supporting fishers, and have extended
mental wellbeing support to fishers (that is currently being provided as part of
the Hector’s and Maui Threat Management Plan).

24. Fisheries New Zealand will keep your office updated of the implementation and
progress with these measures.
