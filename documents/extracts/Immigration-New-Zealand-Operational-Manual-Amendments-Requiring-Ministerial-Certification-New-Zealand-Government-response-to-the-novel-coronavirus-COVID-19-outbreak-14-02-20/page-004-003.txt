Background

Extending the length of time people are subject to the temporary border control measures

1. On February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealand’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.

2.  Togive effect to the new border control measures, on 2 February 2020, you agreed to
amend Border Entry instructions to implement New Zealand’s response to the COVID-19
outbreak. This change denied entry permission to people who have been in, or transited
through, mainland China between 11:59pm 2 February and 11:59pm 16 February 2020.

3. Due to the on-going risks in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak, Ministers with Power to Act
have agreed to extend the temporary border measures for anyone who has been present in
or transited through mainland China within the last 14 days until 24 February 2020.

4. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control
measures:

a. New Zealand citizens

b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders

c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder

d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand

e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrival’ by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers and
marine and aircraft crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific
expedition under the auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.

Amendment to Border Entry instructions

Proposed new immigration instructions

5. The proposed immigration instructions contained in Appendix 1 state that entry permission
must be denied to people who have been in, or transited through, mainland China within 14
days prior to boarding a commercial craft to New Zealand or upon arrival in New Zealand if
travelling other than by commercial craft.

6. The proposed immigration instructions are applicable until 11:59 pm 24 February 2020
unless amended or revoked earlier.

7. Further immigration instructions will be provided for certification if this response needs to be
extended beyond 24 February 2020.

1 Although deemed to hold entry permission it is possible to suspend their visa waiver status for Cruise ship

passengers and marine and aircraft crew at any point between embarkation onto the craft and arrival in New

Zealand. It is also possible to revoke their entry permission and cancel their visa on arrival.
