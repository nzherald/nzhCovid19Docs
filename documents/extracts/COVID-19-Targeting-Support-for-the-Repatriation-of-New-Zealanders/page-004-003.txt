Preferred repatriation options
13 The optimal repatriation air transport options are those that require the least Government
financial or other assistance, and get New Zealanders safely home. The Minister of Foreign
Affairs has agreed that MFAT should rank repatriation options in descending order, from most
to least preferred, as follows:

4, 86(a), $9(2)G), s9(2) (fF) (iv), 9(2)(g) i)

2.

3.

4.

5.
14 \s6(a), $9(2)(j), s9(2)(f) (iv), s9(2)(g) (i)

s9(2)(f(iv), S92

15  Theuse of NZDF assets sits alongside this framework as an option which may be useful
and necessary in particular situations, particularly in the Pacific. This is still resource intensive,
but can nonetheless be a useful niche option. For example, an NZDF C-130 was used to
repatriate 39 New Zealanders on 11 April while returning from delivering aid for Tropical
Cyclone Harold relief. Government-funded medical evacuations are also outside of this
hierarchy. These are typically very expensive and rare, and will be considered on a case-by-
case basis.
Standardised approach to cost recovery for repatriation charters
16 Toensure that the repatriation cost borne by New Zealanders is fair and proportionate,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed on 8 April that New Zealanders be charged a flat fee per
person for government-assisted repatriation flights depending on flight duration as follows: up
to 4 hours ($1,500), 4 to 14 hours ($3,500) and over 14 hours ($5,500).
