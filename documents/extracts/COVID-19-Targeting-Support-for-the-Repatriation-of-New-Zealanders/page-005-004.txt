17 This approach is equitable across flights, simple to understand and administer, provides
predictability, and strikes an appropriate balance between cost recovery and affordability.
Flexibility is retained, however, for deciding on a case-by-case basis the appropriate cost
recovery for charters shared with, or organised by, other countries. The scaled contribution
approach will also not apply to medevacs (which are likely to be more expensive) or the use
of NZDF assets (for which we have a long standing position of not charging). Those
New Zealanders who are not able to afford these contributions upfront are provided an
opportunity to instead sign an undertaking to pay MFAT back after returning to New Zealand.
Stocktake of repatriation efforts so far
18 MFAT is applying its repatriation framework to prioritise its repatriation efforts, while
using the most efficient and cost effective transport options. As at 14 April, consular assistance
of varying kinds has been provided in relation to 25 flights, charter and commercial, that have
brought 530 New Zealanders home. The table below sets out those repatriations to date which
have involved a Government-subsidised charter flight or especially heavy consular assistance,
and records their actual or estimated net cost to government.
