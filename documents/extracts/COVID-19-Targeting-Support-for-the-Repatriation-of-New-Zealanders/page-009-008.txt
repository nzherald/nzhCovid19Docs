29 Some flexibility will also need to be retained in the application of the risk assessment
matrix. $9(2)(f)(iv), $9(2)(g)())

There also
needs to be flexibility around the categorisation of “amber” and “red” countries — and the
treatment of New Zealanders wishing to come home from them. A change in circumstances
may require a change in categorisation with decisions on individual repatriation flights taken
on a case-by-case basis. The feasibility of transit options will also need increasingly to be
taken into account, given how few direct flights to New Zealand now exist and the fact that the
vast majority of New Zealanders now need to take several flights to get home, if they can get
home at all. 's9(2)(f)(iv), s9(2)(g)(i)

Financial implications

30 MFAT has already spent $2,264,200 on repatriation flights. The total direct cost for
further chartered repatriation flights from high risk countries could be as high as $8 million
which would bring total government expenditure on charters due to COVID-19 into the range
of $10-$14 million in this financial year. At this level of spending, this can be absorbed by
MFAT through reprioritising from within the Vote Foreign Affairs baseline due to the reduction
in other activity caused by COVID-19. However, it will require an output expense transfer to
increase the Consular appropriation. This fiscally-neutral transfer will be progressed through
a joint Ministers process. The New Zealand Government is also required to give indemnities
to enter into charter contracts, and the fiscal risk of these varies.
