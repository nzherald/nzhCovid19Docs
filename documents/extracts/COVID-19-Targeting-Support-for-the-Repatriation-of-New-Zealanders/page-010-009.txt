Recommendations

31 ~~ â€˜The Minister of Foreign Affairs recommends that COVID-19 Ministers:

1. Note that hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders remain offshore and that a demand
for government-assisted repatriation could come from between one and several thousand
of them affected by the COVID-19 emergency.

2. Note that New Zealand Government repatriations carried out to date have been expensive
and resource intensive; that the Government cannot bring home all New Zealanders who
wish to return: and that with finite resources there is a need to prioritise future repatriations
$9(2)(g)(i), s9(2)(f) (iv)

3. Note that MFAT is applying a repatriations framework that (i) categorises countries where
New Zealanders are located as being high risk, medium risk, and low risk and (ii) deploys
the most effective and resource-efficient transport options available.

6. Note that the operationalisation of the repatriations will continue to be undertaken by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs
where a Ministerial decision is required.

7. Note that careful sequencing and coordinated planning of repatriation flights will be
required to manage the impact on available capacity for managed isolation/quarantine, as
well as any potential flow-on impacts for the health system and the provision of other
services.
