Recommendation #2 — adding a safe harbour in relation to insolvency-related duties

18 | am proposing the addition of a safe harbour to provide directors with greater certainty about
compliance with the two insolvency-related directors’ duties when considering whether or not
a company should take on new obligations or keep trading.

19 This safe harbour should be enacted for a six month period with the ability of that period to
be extended once only by Order in Council, to allow for the uncertain length of economic
disruption caused by COVID-19.This will deem their decisions to keep on trading for the next
six months, as well as any decisions they make to take on any new obligations over the next
six months, to be reasonable if:

19.1 in the good faith opinion of the directors the company is facing or is likely to face
significant liquidity problems in the next six months as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on them, their creditors or their debtors;

19.2 the company was able to pay its debts as they fell due on 31 December 2019; and

19.3 the directors, in good faith, consider that it is more likely than not that the company
will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within 18 months (for example, because
trading conditions are likely to improve or they are likely to be able to reach an
accommodation with their creditors).

20 This safe harbour will similarly not apply to licensed insurers, registered banks and non-bank
deposit takers on the basis that those classes of entity are prudentially regulated by the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

Recommendation #3 — changes to the voidable transactions regime

21 Last year Cabinet made decisions on a number of insolvency law-related matters [CAB-19-
MIN-0491.01 refers]. These reforms were to be included in an Insolvency Law Reform Bill.

WITHHELD - UNDER ACTIVE CONSIDERATION
The intention had been to release an exposure draft

of the Bill in August 2020.

22 One of the more significant changes relates to the voidable transactions regime, which
allows a liquidator to claw back payments made to creditors prior to the commencement of
the liquidation, in certain circumstances. Among other things, Cabinet agreed to reduce the
period of vulnerability in relation to voidable transactions from two years before the
liquidation commenced to six months where the debtor company and the creditor are
unrelated parties.

23 We are recommending that this change be made via the legislation proposed in this paper. It
would provide potentially significant benefits, given the large number of liquidations that are
likely to result due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
