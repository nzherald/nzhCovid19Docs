Noting Paper: COVID-19

Border Measures Update

To: Ad Hoc Cabinet Committee on COVID-19 Response

From: Hon Dr David Clark, Minister of Health

Date: 24 March 2020

Security level: IN CONFIDENCE

Purpose

1. This paper provides a public health perspective on the paper ‘Additional border control
measures for self-isolation of international arrivals’ in the context of New Zealand
moving to level 4.

Comment

a Public health officials assess that all people arriving from jurisdictions outside the
Pacific carry a very high risk of recent COVID-19 infection due to the high prevalence of
uncontained community transmission in most parts of the world.

4 To illustrate the risk; an international flight of 400 passengers arrived in Auckland today.
50 passengers were referred to temperature screening on the basis of health
assessment. Of these, 35 met the clinical criteria for being swabbed for COVID-19.
(Results are still pending.)

5; Of the current cases in New Zealand 100/102 have been associated with international
travel.

6. The recent policy decision to move to level 4 restrictions on Wednesday 25 March was
made in order to break transmission and flatten the curve. Health officials assess that
allowing a large number of people from high risk areas to enter New Zealand will
inevitably result in a substantial increase of COVID-19 positive cases. This will materially
set back current efforts to break transmission and flatten the curve, through further
spread into the community.
