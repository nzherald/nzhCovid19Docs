8. Options for managing upcoming international arrivals are;

a. Supervised quarantine in facilities at the port of entry (consistent with Level 4).

b. Self-isolation at place of residence (consistent with earlier approach).

c. Stop international flights arriving in New Zealand from all countries except those from
certain Pacific countries for the duration of level 4 restrictions, until a. is in place and
arrivals can be managed to capacity.

9. Public health officials assess that New Zealand's best chance of breaking the
transmission of COVID-19 in the shortest possible period of time will be enabled by
preventing further arrivals for the duration of the level 4 restrictions.

10. We further assess that an exception should be made for New Zealanders returning
from the Pacific on the basis that this group does not represent a high risk of importing
cases of COVID-19 into New Zealand and the numbers involved would be manageable
in terms of supervised quarantine.

Recommendation

It is recommended that the CVD committee:

11. Note that public health officials assess allowing entry to the anticipated large volumes
of people arriving from international destinations poses an unacceptable public health
risk to New Zealand in relation to COVID-19 transmission.

12. Note that public health officials advise that allowing this is inconsistent with the
intentions behind moving to level 4.

13. Agree that the level of public health risk associated with mass international arrivals
justifies halting all international flights arriving in New Zealand for the period that
level 4 restrictions are in place except those arriving from certain Pacific countries.
Those currently in the air should be permitted to land.
