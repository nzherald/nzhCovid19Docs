Temporary Employment Law Changes in Response to COVID-19

The group of Ministers with Power to Act on COVID-19 matters [CAB-20-MIN-0130] convened

on 7 April 2020 at 10.30am, and in accordance with their Power to Act:

if noted that under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the Governor-General on the
recommendation of the Minister in charge of an enactment can modify statutory
requirements or restrictions by Order in Council, if the requirement is such that it would be
impossible or impracticable to comply with during the period for which an Epidemic Notice
is in place, and the modifications go no further than is reasonably necessary in the
circumstances;

2 noted that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety has identified provisions in the
Employment Relations Act 2000 which need to be modified in light of the Epidemic Notice
being in place;

3 s 9(2)(h)

4 agreed to make the following changes through the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006
powers:

41 that the maximum timeframes by which an employer must notify their employees
within work covered by collective bargaining should be extended to exclude the
duration of the Epidemic Notice;

4.2 that the timeframes by which an employer must seek to consolidate collective
bargaining (40 days), and for unions to respond to an attempted consolidation (30
days), should be done as soon as possible, but in any event no later than 40 or 30
days respectively after excluding the duration of the Epidemic Notice;

43 that for collective agreements which would otherwise have expired but are still in
force for 12 months, and where the 12-month period ends within the Epidemic
Notice period or up to three months after, the 12-month period should exclude any
period covered by the Epidemic Notice;

4.4 that ifa union has committed at the outset of collective bargaining to a ratification
procedure that is no longer practicable (e.g. in-person ratification meetings), the
parties should be allowed to agree another means by which to ratify the collective
agreement (e.g. online balloting, videoconferencing or teleconferencing);
