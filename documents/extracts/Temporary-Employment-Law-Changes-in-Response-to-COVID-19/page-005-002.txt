statutory requirements or restrictions by Order in Council, if the requirement is

such that it would be impossible or impracticable to comply with during the

period for which an epidemic notice is in place, and the modifications go no
further than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.

2 Note that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety has identified
provisions in the Employment Relations Act 2000 which need to be modified
in light of the epidemic notice being in place.

3 s 9(2)(h)

4 Agree to amend the provisions below through the Epidemic Preparedness Act
2006 powers:

4.1. That the maximum timeframes by which an employer must notify their
employees within work covered by collective bargaining should be
extended to exclude the duration of the Epidemic Notice.

4.2 That the timeframes by which an employer must seek to consolidate
collective bargaining (40 days), and for unions to respond to an
attempted consolidation (30 days), should be done as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than 40 or 30 days respectively after
excluding the duration of the Epidemic Notice.

4.3. That for collective agreements which would otherwise have expired but
are still in force for 12 months, and where the 12-month period ends
within the Epidemic Notice period or up to three months after, the 12-
month period should exclude any period covered by the Epidemic
Notice.

44 That if a union has committed at the outset of collective bargaining to a
ratification procedure which is no longer practicable (e.g. in-person
ratification meetings) then allow the parties to agree another means by
which to ratify the collective agreement (e.g. online balloting,
videoconferencing or teleconferencing).

5 Invite the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety to prepare drafting
instructions for Parliamentary Counsel Office to give effect to these
recommendations.

6 Authorise the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety to make additional
minor amendments to implement decisions that may arise during the drafting
of the Order in Council.
