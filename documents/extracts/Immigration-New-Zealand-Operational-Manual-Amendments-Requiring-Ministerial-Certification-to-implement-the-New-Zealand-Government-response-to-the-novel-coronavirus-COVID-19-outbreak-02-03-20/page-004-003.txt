Background

Temporary border control measures .

1. On 1 February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealandâ€™s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.

2. On 27 February 2020 Ministers with Power to Act agreed to expand the temporary border
measures to include Iran.

3. On2 March 2020, Cabinet agreed to extend the temporary border measures until 10 March
2020 [CAB-20-MIN-0067].

4. The current temporary border measures deny entry permission to any person who has:

a. been present in or transited through mainland China or Iran within 14 days prior to
boarding

b. been present on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and attempts to travel to New
Zealand within 14 days of disembarking from the cruise ship.

5. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control

measures:

a. New Zealand citizens

b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders

c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder

d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand

e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrival by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers
(who travel to New Zealand as part of a scheduled cruise) and marine and aircraft
crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific expedition under the
auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.

6. The persons referred to in 5(e) above, such as cruise ship passengers and crew, can have
their visa waiver status suspended at any point between embarkation onto the cruise ship
and arrival in New Zealand. In the case of such a suspension, their travel to New Zealand
would be without legal basis, but they are still deemed to hold a visa and have been granted
entry permission on arrival into New Zealand internal waters. MBIE is currently undertaking
further work to consider options in the marine space in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

7. The following proposed changes to immigration instructions extend the temporary border
