Matter to be considered Comment

Section 164(2)(a) The Rule will temporarily extend all WoFs and CoFs, driver licences

transport safety in each proposed | Applicable documents that expired on or after 1 Jan 2020 (and

activity or service endorsements from 1 March 2020) would be deemed valid from the
date the Rule is in force. This would apply for no more than six
months after the rule comes into force.
While this extension may create some additional road safety risk,
we consider this risk is outweighed by the risk that some members
of the public may not otherwise have access to a private vehicle,
which is regarded as a critical lifeline at this time. It also enables
transport service operators to maintain critical supply chain and
essential services vehicles.
Moreover, the proposed change does not remove the existing and
separate legal requirements that a vehicle is safe to operate, and
for drivers to be medically fit to drive, and comply with the road
rules and any relevant restrictions on their licence. These
requirements will continue to be enforced by NZ Police.
