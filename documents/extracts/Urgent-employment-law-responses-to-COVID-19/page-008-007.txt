Other measures may be desirable but we believe they would require new legislation

28. Other urgent modifications to employment law may be desirable to achieve two purposes:
a. Limit the risks of essential services workers or employers taking industrial action

while the EN is in place (discussed further below).

b. Provide the right set of rules and incentives, to support businesses to remain
solvent through the period of COVID-19 restrictions, through modifications to rules
on good faith and redundancy.

. Further advice can be provided on the impact of these measures if
you wish.

There is a risk of industrial action involving essential service workers in relation to collective

bargaining or health and safety grounds

31. Some essential service workers are currently collective bargaining. There is a risk that
industrial action in relation to that collective bargaining may be taken under the
Employment Relations Act 2000 (ER Act). Depending on the nature of the essential
service, workers or employers are required to provide between 24 hours (bus drivers) to
28 daysâ€™ (health care workers where the impacts affect the public interest, including public
health and safety) notice of any industrial action.

32. Based on the absence of current notices of industrial action (see paragraphs 7 to 9), we
consider that this is a low risk, but industrial action occurring during the period the
Epidemic Notice is in place cannot be ruled out. To minimise this risk, public messaging
from the Prime Minister or other Ministers and the Council of Trade Unions could
emphasise that strikes relating to collective bargaining are not appropriate at this time.

33. There is also a potential risk that essential services workers will strike on health and
safety grounds while the Epidemic Notice is in place, particularly in the health sector.
Strikes are permitted by s84 of the ER Act if the employees who strike have reasonable
grounds for believing that the strike is justified on the grounds of safety or health.

34. The Ministry of Health advises that there is a risk that some unions may use the ability to
strike for health and safety grounds to respond to changes to workplace arrangements
made by DHBs in their COVID-19 response, such as changes to shift patterns and
rosters.
