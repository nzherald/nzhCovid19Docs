35. There are real risks to essential workers from catching COVID-19, as well as other
impacts from long hours in a high-stress environment. Health and safety risks may justify
industrial action. However, a strike could result in a protracted debate on the extent of
these risks, which would not factor in the greater good of having those essential tasks
performed.

You could also make changes to support the Enhanced Wage Subsidy Scheme

36. The overarching objective of the Enhanced Wage Subsidy Scheme (or furloughed worker
policy) is to support otherwise viable employers to survive the shutdown period and
remain connected to their employees so that the economy is better able to restart when
COVID-19 has been eliminated.

37. We have identified that the following changes to employment law could potentially
support the Enhanced Wage Subsidy Scheme (depending on final decisions for that
scheme):

a. Amendments to provide that if an employer unilaterally reduces an employee’s
hours, the employer's unilateral action is not of itself a breach of the obligation of
good faith in s4 of the Employment Relations Act 2000

b. Measures to prevent employers or employees from triggering redundancy
provisions while using the wage subsidy scheme

38. Further advice can be provided on these matters if requested.

Next Steps

39. Once you have made decisions on this paper, the following steps will be required if an
immediate modification notice under s15 of the EPA is to progress:
¢ Legal approval that the provisions can proceed (Crown Law and PCO)
¢ Policy approval (Cabinet or Ministers with Power to Act)
¢ Order-in-Council drafting then approval (by Cabinet or Ministers with Power to Act)

e Executive Council / Governor-General approval and publication of the Order-in-
Council.

40. To expedite this process, you may wish to share this paper with Ministers with Powers to
Act, if you agree to an immediate modification notice proceeding.
