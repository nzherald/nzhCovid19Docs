Other collective bargaining provisions do not need modifications, or do not meet the
requirements for EPA modification — we will also review the provisions for individual
employment agreements
19. Wealso considered other provisions but do not believe they need to be modified because
they specify no hard timeframe for compliance. We expect parties to take the Epidemic
Notice period into account in what they consider to be reasonable timeframes for the
following provisions:
* s32(1)(b) Duty to meet each other, from time to time, for the purposes of the
bargaining.
¢ s32(1)(c) Duty to consider and respond to proposals made by each other.
e s33 Duty to conclude collective agreement
20. We also considered s50B (facilitation grounds). The Employment Relations Authority is
continuing to operate via teleconference through the duration of the EN, so it is not
“impracticable or impossible” to comply with these provisions.
21. We-will review whether similar modifications are required to provisions for individual
employment agreements and will provide advice on this early next week.
Non-collective bargaining measures could also be achieved via an
EPA notice
