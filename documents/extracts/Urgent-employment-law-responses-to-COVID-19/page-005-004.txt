10. Since 6 March we have received two applications where the mediation topic itself relates
directly to COVID-19. They are all individual work related problems. COVID-19-related
mediations will continue to be prioritised. There is currently one application received this
week involving an individual’s absence from work in the medical sector. The parties will
be offered telephone mediation.

11. Employment Services has observed that parties do not want to mediate at the moment.
Mixed reactions are received to suggestions of telephone mediation, with either request
for deferral or just one party agreeing to the changed process. Six Employment Relations
Authority Directed or Referred matters have been received in the last two days.

Urgent modifications are needed for requirements that are impossible

or impractical to comply with

12. We recommend urgent modifications to some requirements in employment law are
required, to ensure the operation of the epidemic does not result in employers or
employees breaching their obligations under employment law, if those obligations are
impossible or impractical to comply with.

Framework for decisions

13. In assessing which employment laws could be modified during the period that an
Epidemic Notice is in place (or the government's broader response to COVID-19 is in
place), where possible we sought to uphold freedom of choice, good faith and the
promotion of agreement. However, in some circumstances, this had to be balanced with
the need to ensure swift action.

14. For example, modifications to restrictions or requirements in employment law may be
appropriate to reduce the risks of liability that may impact on employer's ability to remain
solvent, and ultimately, the greater good for more employees in the longer term.

15. The options recommended would be time-limited to enable recovery and confidence in
the rule of law when the Epidemic Notice is lifted. This approach is consistent with the
ability recognised by International Labour Organisation to make reasonable modifications,
in a time of national emergency, to New Zealand's international obligations to respect
labour standards, including of freedom of association and the right to collectively bargain.

Measures to suspend timeframes for collective bargaining could be

achieved via an EPA notice

16. You have asked about the ability to use s15 EPA in relation to collective bargaining.

17. We have applied the following principle in our advice: to not remove collective bargaining
rights, nor to end any collective bargaining that is underway, but merely to delay
obligations until they can reasonably be fulfilled following the revocation of the EN.

18. In order to do this we consider that the following restrictions or requirements would need
to be modified, and could be done under s15 of the EPA:
