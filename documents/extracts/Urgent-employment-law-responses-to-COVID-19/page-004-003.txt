Purpose

1. This note provides advice on urgent employment law issues relating to COVID-19,
including suspending timeframes for collective bargaining while the Epidemic Notice is in
force.

Background

An Epidemic Notice has been issued

2. An Epidemic Notice (EN) is a vehicle for introducing a broader range of powers ona
national scale. Under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 (EPA), the Prime Minister
may issue an EN on recommendation of the Director-General of Health, and must be
satisfied that the effects of an outbreak of a quarantinable disease are likely to
significantly disrupt (or continue to disrupt) essential government and business activity in
New Zealand. The Prime Minister did so on 23 March 2020.

Epidemic Notices can enable modifications to other statues in response to an epidemic

3. | Once an EN has been issued, section 15 of the EPA allows the Governor-General to
make Orders in Council on recommendation by a Minister responsible for the
administration of an enactment to modify any requirements or restrictions imposed by the
enactment.

4. Section 15 allows modification of any enactment only to the extent that there is a
legislative requirement or restriction, that is impossible or impractical to comply
with. Any modifications must not go further than what is reasonably necessary in the
situation.

5. It should also be noted that employment agreements also set requirements on employers
and employees (ie employment standards or requirements are minimum standards or
requirements that can be expanded upon in employment agreements and frequently are).
A notice under the EPA cannot modify those agreements.

An Enhanced Wage Subsidy Scheme is being considered by Ministers

6. | The Enhanced Wage Subsidy Scheme (or furloughed worker policy) aims to ensure:

a. People are supported to stay at home and firms to cease trading, rather than being
forced to work or trade for financial reasons; and

b. Otherwise viable firms survive the shutdown period and remain connected to their
employees, so that the economy is better able to restart when COVID-19 has been
eliminated.

There are currently no active strike applications

7. Employment Services has no high impact mediations or actions scheduled in the next two
weeks. ‘High impact mediations or actions’ include collective bargaining, employment
disputes or industrial action in an essential industry, or an otherwise sensitive matter with
high public interest and/or high potential impact.

8. Similarly, there are no current requests for Collective Bargaining mediation. This may
change over the coming week as we work through past collective bargaining applications
to understand where parties are at.

9. There are also no current strike applications. In the month of March, there were 26
notices of strike action involving seven organisations, most notably, strike action by
Auckland bus drivers and APEX laboratory workers. Both notices have been withdrawn.
