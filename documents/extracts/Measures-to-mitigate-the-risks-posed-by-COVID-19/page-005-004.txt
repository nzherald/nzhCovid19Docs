Operational Settings

21 Corrections has moved to ensure all future work is aligned with the New Zealand COVID-
19 alert levels. Future planning undertaken by the Incident Management Team will be
consistent with these levels. This would, for example, guide our actions if an outbreak was
to occur within an individual site, versus our actions if a wider outbreak was to occur.

22 Acknowledging that level 2 includes the need for physical distancing and alternative ways
of working, we have taken actions regarding non-essential functions working from home
that are also consistent with the alert levels. As part of this the Executive Leadership
Team has been split into two teams - A and B. Team B is working from home this week.
Any movement up the levels is anticipated in our forward planning.

Vulnerable Staff

23 Alert level 2 also includes a requirement that high-risk people remain at home. This,
alongside our own health and wellness obligations to staff has meant that certain actions
have been taken with respect to vulnerable staff. These actions are:

Â° Staff of 70 years and over to stay at home

e Staff taking immunosuppressive medicines, to stay at home

e Staff who have certain conditions or situations such as pregnancy, heart conditions,
hypertension, lung and kidney conditions, or who are living with people with these
conditions, continue with their work as normal, provided that their condition is such
that they are well enough to come to work.

24 The decision in relation to vulnerable staff will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and when
alert levels change.
