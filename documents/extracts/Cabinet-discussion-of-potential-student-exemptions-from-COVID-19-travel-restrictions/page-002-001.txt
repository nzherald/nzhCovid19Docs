. An update and overview from the Minister of Immigration on the processing of
exemptions to the border restrictions.

Ministries of Education and Health and MBIE, along with a draft set of talking points for your
oral item.

of concern, and in particular, the Diamond Princess and

. Cabinet is being asked to roll-over the wider border restrictions and a decision is

include both.
