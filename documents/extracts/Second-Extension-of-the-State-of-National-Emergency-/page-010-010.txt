This declaration by the Minister of Civil Defence extending the State of National Emergency can be found
in the Gazette https://gazette.govt.nz/
What is the difference between the Alert Levels and the State of National Emergency?
The State of National Emergency and the COVID-19 Alert Levels are two distinct and separate things. The
Alert Levels specify the range of measures that we are taking against COVID-19. A State of National
Emergency provides the people managing the response in an emergency, in this case COVID-19, access to
powers they would not normally have, but might require now to implement and enforce these measures.
The Alert Levels can be applied without a State of National Emergency, and a State of National Emergency
can be declared without Alert Levels being used.
However, the powers made available by the State of National Emergency do support and help us enforce
the measures being applied at higher Alert Levels. The powers have been used a number of times so far,
including to stop people doing non-essential activities and to requisition a carpark so it can be used as a
community based assessment centre.
These powers are complementary to the powers available under the Health Act.
