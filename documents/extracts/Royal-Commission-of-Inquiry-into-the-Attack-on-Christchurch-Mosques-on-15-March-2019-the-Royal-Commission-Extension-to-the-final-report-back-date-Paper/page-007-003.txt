following consultation with the Attorney and Chair, felt that such further amendment
was necessary and appropriate. This would provide some assurance to affected parties
that the report would not be delayed unnecessarily.
Preferred option - Extension to 31 July 2020 with ability to vary
reporting date if required

43. On balance, amending the terms of reference to set a new report date of 31 July 2020
and to enable the Minister of Internal Affairs to vary that reporting date if required is
the preferred option. The current level of uncertainty created by the COVID-19
pandemic on both the Royal Commission and on agencies means that having some
flexibility in the reporting date would enable the current risks to be managed more
effectively.

44. There may be some adverse comment about the delay in the report and the lack of
clarity about the actual reporting date. However, this risk is outweighed by the need to
ensure we have the flexibility to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial Implications

45. There will be some cost implications in extending the final reporting date for the Royal
Commission. The funding will be required to continue to pay Commissioners’ fees, to
retain property and services and the current Secretariat for the extended period

59(2)(A)(iv) - required for the Royal Commission to finalise its report.

47. As aninterim measure, the Department will reprioritise existing funding from within
Vote Internal Affairs baselines in the short-term to meet the Royal Commission's costs
up to the end of May 2020. The Department will need to reprioritise its existing
resources and work programmes to meet these additional funding needs which may
lead to a reduction in the provision of goods and services or rescinding commitments
that have been entered into.

48. The Department is currently focussed on the COVID-19 response which will require
significant reprioritisation of its existing funding. This means the Department will be
unable to reprioritise funding to meet the Royal Commission’s needs beyond May 2020.
