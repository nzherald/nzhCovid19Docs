Recommendations
62. The Minister for Internal Affairs recommends that the Cabinet Business Committee:

1. note that on 10 November 2019, Cabinet approved additional funding of $3.000
million and a revised final report back date of 30 April 2020 [CAB-19-MIN-0584
refers];

2. note that the Royal Commission has advised that it will be unable to deliver its
report by 30 April 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional
uncertainty regarding when the Royal Commission will be able to deliver its final
report;

3. note that there are a number of considerations when deciding on an extension
date, including:

3.1. the need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic context;

3.2. the time between the attack and the Inquiry report;

3.3. the timeframes for additional, system-wide improvements necessary following
the attack; and,

3.4. the cost of an extension.

4. note that on balance amending the terms of reference to set a report date of
31 July 2020 and to allow the Minister of Internal Affairs to vary that date for the
final report is the preferred option;

5. agree to amend the terms of reference for the Royal Commission so that the
reporting date will be 31 July 2020, or such earlier or later date as may be
determined by the Minister of Internal Affairs, in consultation with the Attorney-
General, to be feasible and appropriate, after consultation with the Chair of the
Royal Commission;

6. note that additional funding required by the Royal Commission will be met from
Departmental baselines until the end of May 2020;
