Security Level — In Confidence

. MPI officials are working closely with the New Zealand rock lobster industry, which
appears to be the sector most acutely affected at this time, to consider options that
might provide relief to fishers and exporters.

Background

1. Most primary sectors are experiencing some disruption to their trade with China as
a result of the Coronavirus, including issues with supply chains, delayed payments,
cancelled orders, and cessation of some airfreight services. Lower consumer
confidence, combined with other factors such as travel restrictions to China will
likely affect overall Chinese consumer spending on high value products. This in
turn will likely cause other flow on effects that will impact sectors more broadly (e.g.
labour and employment etc.). The forestry and seafood industries are the most
severely impacted at this stage.

Seafood industry concerns

2. The seafood industry is particularly concerned about holding product in the water
and the lack of cold storage space. The key concern is around live/chilled products
(e.g. rock lobster, chilled salmon, mussels, paua etc.) that are highly perishable.
These account for approximately 45% of fisheries exports to China. These
products are likely to be diverted to other lower value markets in the short-term.

3. Aside from the live rock lobster industry, the main airfreighted seafood product is
chilled salmon. Chilled salmon accounts for less than 1% of seafood exports on

New Zealand’s current seafood export products and markets

4. Mussels, rock lobster, salmon, orange roughy and paua make up a significant
portion of New Zealand's live/chilled export products.

5. The top countries that New Zealand export to by total value in each species
(referred above) are China, United States, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong,
Japan, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore.

6. Appendix One highlights the export value and market share for the top four
countries for each species.
