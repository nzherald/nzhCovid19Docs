Notices under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006
Purpose of report
This paper recommends that the Prime Minister give an Epidemic Notice, under the Epidemic
Preparedness Act 2006, and seeks agreement from the Minister of Health.
This paper also recommends that the Prime Minister give an Epidemic Management Notice, and
seeks agreement from the Ministers of Social Development and Immigration.
Key points
® The Prime Minister must consider the written recommendation of the Director-General of
Health prior to giving an Epidemic Notice.
e¢ My recommendation is that the Prime Minister give an Epidemic Notice because the effects
of a COVID-19 outbreak are likely to disrupt or continue to disrupt essential governmental
and business activity in New Zealand significantly.
® Giving an Epidemic Notice will trigger some self-executing provisions in some enactments.
e As soon as possible after giving an Epidemic Notice, the Prime Minister must present a copy
to Parliament.
@ Once an Epidemic Notice is given, the Prime Minister, with the agreement of the Minister
responsible for the enactment concerned, may give Epidemic Management Notices.
Epidemic Management Notices trigger a number of other self-executing provisions in other
enactments.
@ In addition, once an Epidemic Notice is given, some legislative requirements and restrictions
can be lifted via Modification Orders by Ministers making a recommendation to the
Governor General.
