provisions would allow more people to receive support, faster, and are described below:

b. $299 provides that during the period of the notice, MSD may grant a benefit to a
person even if their claim has not been at all, or has not been fully, inquired into as
required by s298 of the Act. This may be required where staffing priorities mean
conducting the usual inquiries are not feasible.

required because the government has already enacted regulations to override
stand down periods for the next 8 months);
