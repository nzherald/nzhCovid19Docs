68. While the CDEM Act has specific powers that may be required later in the COVID-19
response (e.g. entry onto premises or evacuations), the CDEM Act was not designed to
address the systems of flow-on implications Immigration New Zealand, the Ministry of
Social Development or Local Government Authorities are currently facing.

69. In particular, it does not allow for modifications to other pieces of legislation. Officials will
provide Cabinet with further advice if this assessment changes.

70. See Appendix 1 for more information on the difference between Epidemic Management
Notices and a state of emergency.

Timing

71, As soon as possible after giving an Epidemic Notice (by way of publication in the Gazette),
the Prime Minister must present a copy of it to Parliament. If Parliament is not due to sit
until a day more than 7 days after the day on which the notice is given, then Parliament
must organise to sit within that 7 day period.

72. Parliament is not sitting 20 March 2020 to 30 March 2020. We therefore recommend the
Epidemic Notice come into effect on 24 March 2020. It may then be presented to
Parliament as soon as possible. Parliament could meet to consider it on 31 March 2020 (a
regularly scheduled sitting).

73. However, officials recommend activating the visa extension powers under the Immigration
Act from 2 April 2020. This will ensure the extension applies to the interim open study
rights visa that is automatically granted to students with visa applications still awaiting
processing on 1 April. Bringing these powers into force earlier than 2 April would create
more processing rework for Immigration New Zealand.
