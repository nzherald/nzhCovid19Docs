36 ~=— Any use of the flights to repatriate New Zealanders would need to be calibrated
against our public health requirements at Level 4, including the requirements on return
for self-isolation and, if necessary, quarantine. This critical aspect would need to be
informed by judgments made by our border and health ecosystem as to what tempo and
number of arrivals can be managed on a given day, over and above current arrival
numbers.
Foreign-assisted charter flights — processes
37 Foreign governments, working with contracted airlines, would do the heavy lifting
in terms of operating any charter flights to return their stranded foreign nationals. This
would include following confirmed procedures for ground transportation and domestic
transfers as set out in Annex 1, to organise the door-to-door transportation for their
nationals to the international departure airport in New Zealand. Foreign governments
would also be required to confirm that departing nationals would be accepted home (and
could transit third countries as necessary between New Zealand and their home
destination). Health protocols and checks would be applied as appropriate at Level 4.
38 A dedicated inter-agency team would be stood up through the Operational
Command Centre to manage the tempo and frequency of the flights, to ensure that the
capacity of the system in a Level 4 environment was appropriately managed.

39 As foreshadowed in the paper approved by CVD on 31 March on an All of
Government Plan for Managing Stranded People, there may be specific partners with
which it would be in our interests to revisit the transit restrictions currently in place, in
order to allow for movement of 3rd country nationals. This could enable foreign nationals
stranded in the Pacific to join evacuation cohorts in New Zealand, as well as re-open
