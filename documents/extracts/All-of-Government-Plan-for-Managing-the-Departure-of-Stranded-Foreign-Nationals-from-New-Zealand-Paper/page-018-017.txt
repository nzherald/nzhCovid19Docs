e Anumber of Governments have approached us to request assistance for so-called
‘mercy flights’ to pick up their nationals. These may be aircraft chartered
specifically by Governments, or they may be commercial options if still available.

e In both of these situations, the issue we have been weighing has been whether we
can safely allow the movement of foreign nationals within New Zealand to get them
to an international airport to catch their flight home.

e Passengers will not be allowed to travel if they are at risk of COVID-19 — or more
specifically, they would only be able to travel if they:

o are not diagnosed with COVID-19

o donot have symptoms consistent with COVID-19

o have not been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting results

o are nota close contact of a suspected/probable/confirmed case of COVID-
19, and

o have not travelled internationally within the last 14 days

o On arrival at the airport, passengers will be required to undertake a health
questionnaire confirming they meet the above requirements, and will be
subject to social distancing requirements prior to departure.

e Governments from over 20 countries have made approaches to the New Zealand
Government about assistance for those nationals to leave.

e And similarly, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working hard to help New
Zealanders who are stranded in other countries to return home.

e We will be taking a strict approach to ensuring that public health remains the top
priority throughout this exercise.
