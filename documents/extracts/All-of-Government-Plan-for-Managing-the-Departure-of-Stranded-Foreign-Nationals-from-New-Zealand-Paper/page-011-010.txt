some key transit routes to maximise pathways for New Zealanders to return

Strategic communications
41 Agreement to the recommendations in this paper would require careful
communication given that the proposals create additional exemptions to the restrictions
on domestic travel set at 23:59 on Friday 27 March. New Zealanders may see this as a
move as creating greater public health risk by increasing the movement of people
domestically. And those foreign nationals prevented from taking ticketed flights after
27 March may be critical of what looks like an about-turn.
42 Attached as Annex 3 are proposed public communication messages, to support
the decisions recommended in this paper to be announced on the afternoon of 2 April.
These would be accompanied by a targeted strategy to ensure that those who need to
know, do.
