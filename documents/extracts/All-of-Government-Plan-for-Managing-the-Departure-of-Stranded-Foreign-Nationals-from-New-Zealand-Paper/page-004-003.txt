15. Agree that the current moratorium on foreign government assisted departure flights
be lifted, with the tempo and capacity of such flights to be actively managed,
commensurate with COVID-19 Alert Level 4 and processes for managing the safe
return of New Zealanders into self-isolation and, as necessary, quarantine.

16.Note that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be responsible for leading
negotiations with foreign governments on these government assisted departure
flights.

Announcement and messaging

19. Agree that these the above decisions should be publicly announced on the afternoon
of 2 April (drawing on the strategic communications messaging in Annex 3) and
implemented immediately thereafter.

20. Note that officials will develop a more detailed messaging framework to explain these
decisions. This will include making it clear that passengers must comply with all health
requirements, including a number of COVID-19 related questions, before undertaking
travel.
