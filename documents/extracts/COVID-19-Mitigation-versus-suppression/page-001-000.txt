COVID-19 Mitigation versus suppression
e Our strategy is focusing on keeping COVID-19 out, stamping it out and slowing it down.
e Our aim is to prevent widespread outbreaks. Allowing widespread outbreaks (ie trajectories along the orange and blue curves (‘flattening the curve’)) will significantly overwhelm the health system.
e The strategy centres on border restrictions, intense testing, aggressive contact tracing, and stringent self-isolation and quarantine.
e Physical distancing will also be required to varying degrees as we continue along this path.
e Wecan call this a suppression strategy.
e Should outbreaks occur, a suppression strategy aims to reverse epidemic growth through tougher public health measures— eg by more intense physical distancing and travel restrictions.
e@ The aim is to ensure that health system capacity is not exceeded through strengthening public health measures.
e@ When cases fall, public health measures can be eased slightly.
e This cycle repeats itself (refer squiggly green line).
e However, we must still prepare for times when capacity of the health system is exceeded by having ‘surge’ options.
e Asuppression strategy does incur significant economic and social disruption. Longer periods of physical distancing, including school closures, will be required.
e However, many lives will be saved and more people remain well so are able to operate the economy and the health care system.
@ We would need to maintain this approach until a vaccine is developed, which is at least January 2021, and/or the global pandemic has passed.
e This approach is distinct from a mitigation strategy, which focuses on reducing the size of the peak (ie moving from the orange curve to the blue curve).
