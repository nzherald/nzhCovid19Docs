Security Level — In Confidence

eC)

. MPI officials are working closely with the New Zealand rock lobster industry, which
appears to be the sector most acutely affected at this time, to consider options that
might provide relief to fishers and exporters. No decisions have been made yet.

Background

Impact on primary sector trade flows and exports

1. While it is too early to determine the full impact of Coronavirus on China’s economy,
supply chains, and global markets, some impacts on New Zealand’s primary sector
trade are becoming evident.

2. Most sectors are experiencing some disruption to their trade with China including
issues with supply chains, delayed payments, cancelled orders, and cessation of some
airfreight services. Lower consumer confidence, combined with other factors such as
travel restrictions to China will likely affect overall consumer spending on high value
products.

. Dairy: The majority of dairy products are still exported via shipment with limited
risks or impacts at this point, due to the Chinese New Year normally being a quiet
period. The limited product being sent via airfreight has been affected with the
cancelation of Air New Zealand flights. This has predominately impacted e-
commerce purchases. If other overseas airlines reduce or cancel flights to or from
New Zealand, there would be greater risk to dairy exports, particularly infant
formula.

° Meat: The largest concern for the meat industry is clearance delays at ports,
creating a shortage in cold store space in both China and New Zealand. There
will likely be deferrals to future orders and some New Zealand product is being
shipped to other markets, driving down the price. The Meat Industry Association
reports that products that can be directed to other markets (especially lamb and
prime beef) are being redirected, while there are more challenges with mutton
and some manufacturing beef. If the situation is prolonged, this may create
problems at the farm level, especially in dry regions where processing plants are
under capacity pressure. MPI is in regular contact with the meat industry on this.
