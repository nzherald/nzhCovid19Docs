. Dairy: The majority of dairy products are still expected via shipment with no known
risks or impacts, due to the Chinese New Year being a quiet period in any case. The
limited product being sent via air freight has been affected with the cancelation of Air
New Zealand flights. This has predominately impacted e-commerce purchases. If other
overseas airlines reduce or cancel flights to or from New Zealand, there would be
greater risk to dairy exports, particularly infant formula.

° Meat: The largest concern for the meat industry is clearance delays at ports, creating
a shortage in cold store space in both China and New Zealand. There will likely be
deferrals to future orders and some New Zealand product is being shipped to other
markets, driving down the price. Effects of this will be felt in the long term, and at this
stage industry is considering an interim scaling back of exports to China. Industry and
farm representatives are concerned at the compounding impact of near-drought
conditions in parts of New Zealand.

° Horticulture: The largest risk moving forward for horticultural exports is if kiwifruit
shipments are stopped or reduced. Early kiwifruit exports to China start in March,
reaching full force in April. The product can have a long shelf life if appropriate cold
storage is available but will lose value over time. China accounts for 25% of New
Zealand's kiwifruit export market so there may be some ability to divert product for a
few months. The success of this may be largely determined by the nature of Zespri’s
contacts. Summerfruit New Zealand has stated that the majority of New Zealand’s
cherries have already successfully entered China.

. Forestry: Impacts on product flow through ports is the largest issue facing forestry,
and with delays also reducing the quality of the logs exported. In February, logs on
average account for 81% of forestry exports. Smaller companies are looking to sell to
domestic processors, rather than exporting to avoid value loss. Industry discussions
are taking place today regarding a temporary halt to harvesting and cartage
operations. There are media reports of forestry crews being sent home for the
foreseeable future. At least one major log exporter - Pacific Forest Products (PFP) -
has had their latest shipment to China cancelled. PFP are stopping all log exports from
this Wednesday due to there being no guarantee of payment. Likewise Chinese
manufacturers are shut, with no guarantee of discharge of consignment at port.

17. The New Zealand Government has limited ability to manage many of the risks and
disruptions as a result of Coronavirus — including port and transport delays and changes in
market conditions. MPI is however working to ensure exporters are updated on the situation
so they can implement their own contingency plans.

Business Support

18. NZTE is launching a landing pad on their website today that will provide advice and
information for exporters on Coronavirus, working with MFAT, MP! and Customs to ensure a
co-ordinated approach. NZTE also setting up an advisory service for exporters to talk to
experts if they need advice which will be available to non-NZTE customers.

19. MBIE has developed a framework and decision model, based on our experience of providing
support after various emergency events. The framework and decision model have been used
in the past to determine specific businesses that are eligible for targeted, short-term support
(for example the recent support package for Whakaari/White Island business directly affected
by the eruption).

20. Acchallenge for using emergency business support in this situation would be the difficultly of
identifying impact. While for some businesses this will be quite obvious as they generate
