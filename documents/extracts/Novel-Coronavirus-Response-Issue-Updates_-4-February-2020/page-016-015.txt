Security Level — In Confidence

° Horticulture: The largest risk for horticultural exports is if kiwifruit shipments are
stopped or reduced. Early kiwifruit exports to China start in March, reaching full
force in April. The product can have a long shelf life if appropriate cold storage is
available but will lose value over time. China accounts for 25% of New Zealand’s
kiwifruit export market so there may be some ability to divert product for a few
months. The success of this may be largely determined by the nature of Zespri’s
contacts. Summerfruit New Zealand has stated that the majority of New Zealand’s
cherries have already successfully entered China. Harvesting of apples has
started this week therefore if disruptions continue there will be impacts for this
sector too.

¢ Forestry: The build-up of unprocessed log inventories in China P@XeaXv/92NeN)

and the potential for a significant reduction in log
export prices due to over-supply is the main concern of the forestry sector. Pre-
emptive action by the industry is having flow on impacts to forest harvesting and
transport companies and could have an impact on employment. Some forest
companies have put a pause on or are reducing harvesting, others are focusing
on selling more volume to domestic processors. However there is a limit to the
volume domestic processing can absorb. Forest owners are focusing on moving
their current inventory of felled logs in forest or on wharf to market as it is the peak
season for sap stain and log quality will degrade if left unprocessed for too
long. The largest log exporter to China (Pacific Forest Products) has also
announced it is pausing exports to China from Wednesday night to prevent further
exacerbating the situation. The forestry sector was burnt by a sudden drop in log
prices in the middle of 2019 when there was a similar build-up of log inventory. In
February, logs on average account for 81% of forestry exports. MPI is working
with the forestry sector to better understand and plan for consequences of an
extended shut down of the wood processing and construction industry in China
beyond the Chinese New Year holidays. There are media reports of forestry crews
being sent home for the foreseeable future.

e Seafood: The seafood industry is concerned about holding product in the water
and the lack of cold storage space. The key concern is around live/chilled products
(e.g. rock lobster, chilled salmon, mussels, paua etc.) that are highly perishable.
These account for approximately 45% of fisheries exports to China. These
products are likely to be diverted to other lower value markets in the short-term.
Aside from the live rock lobster industry, the main airfreighted seafood product is
chilled salmon. Chilled salmon accounts for less than 1% of seafood exports on
average in February. 59(2)(){ii)

The impact on remaining fisheries exports (e.g. mainly
frozen) is likely to be determined by the level of broader disruption in China.
