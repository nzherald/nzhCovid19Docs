Annex One: Suggested Talking Points on the economic and trade
impacts of the novel Coronavirus outbreak
General

. New Zealand acknowledges the significant challenges China faces to contain the
spread of the Corona virus.

. Although New Zealand is an outward facing nation, we must take all measures to stop
the virus from spreading and to protect New Zealanders and our Pacific Island
neighbours.

Impact on NZ trade

° Trade officials are carefully monitoring how the Corona virus is affecting New Zealand
businesses.

. In the short term we expect New Zealand's tourism and international education sectors
to feel the most significant impact of the Corona virus due to travel restrictions that
China and other countries have put in place.

° The government is working closely with the tourism and international education
industries to reduce the impact on them as much as possible.

° There are no formal restrictions on market access for goods exports and imports, and
trade regulatory conditions are unaffected.

. However, the Government is aware of reports that some sectors have already seen a
fall in demand for their products or have been affected by delays at the border due to
travel restrictions in China.

. This includes reports that forestry and log exporters are facing delays at the border.

° Flight cancellations by some airlines may also affect airfreight shipments of certain
perishable goods to China.

. We understand that these delays are cause for concern to our exporters. However, it is
hoped these impacts will be temporary and can be minimised. Experience with
previous outbreaks of this kind, such as SARS, suggests that when the virus is
contained, activity will soon return to normal.

° To help ensure New Zealand exporters have the latest information, NZTE is setting up
a webpage. This page will include contact details on how exporters can seek further
help from agencies including MFAT, MPI, NZTE and Customs. It is planned that the
web page will be live within the next 24 hours.

° Until the NZTE webpage goes live, trade and export issues related to the Corona virus
can be directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Exporter Helpline - 0800
824 605 or by email on exports@mfat.net

° [If pressed on the economic impact of the government's restrictions on foreign
travellers from China] Our first priority is to limit the spread of this virus. Prior to the
entry restriction the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism had ordered travel
agencies to suspend selling group tours. It is unknown if the New Zealand
government’s entry restrictions will have a further impact at this point.
