Reopening of e-gates

4. Regarding re-opening of e-gates, Customs is considering the options for possible partial re-
opening. Formal advice on this issue will be available to Ministers later today (Tuesday 4
February).

5. Customs, Immigration and the Ministry of Health are continuously engaging with overseas
partners to ascertain which countries have travel restrictions that match or exceed
New Zealand’s measures. The aim will be to use these countries’ passenger screening
processes so we can reduce our own need to screen passengers from those countries.

6. Australia, Singapore and the United States all introduced travel restrictions similar to
New Zealand’s. Customs has confirmed that these countries are applying their restrictions to
both arriving and transiting passengers.

7. Customs is determining whether there are unforeseen risks or potential unintended
consequences of doing this. It will provide this advice back to Ministry of Health for approval
before recommending any decision to re-open the e-gates.

Regarding whether consideration is being given to the provision of welfare (benefits) for

industries impacted by the virus (such as forestry)

8. The usual range of financial assistance will be available for individuals in need of help. This
could include ongoing assistance for those who no longer have an income or one-off payments.
for those who have an immediate need e.g. for food.

paper and can be found elsewhere in the proactive release.
