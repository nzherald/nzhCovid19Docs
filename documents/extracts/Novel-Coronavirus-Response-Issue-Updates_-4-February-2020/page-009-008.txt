10. In addition to this, Tourism NZ is also looking at re-deploying marketing resource into other
markets.

International Education

41. Itis too early to predict impacts with any accuracy. International education is New Zealandâ€™s
fifth largest export market worth $5.1 billion in 2018. There are currently 27,287 Chinese
nationals who hold a valid visa enabling study in New Zealand. Of this total number 12,514
are in New Zealand and 14,773 are outside New Zealand (as of 25/1/2020).

12. Chinese students are the greatest proportion of international students in both the secondary
and tertiary sector. The majority of students usually arrive in the first three months of the
year. Most international school students have arrived, but the bulk of the tertiary students are
expected in coming weeks.

13. Education agencies are assessing immediate and medium-term impacts of the Coronavirus,
in particular the closure of borders to Chinese nationals. This assessment will include the
likely loss of revenue and economic value from students not being able to enrol. Market
impacts will be common across English-speaking countries so the risk of significant flight to
competitor countries is low and may limit longer term impacts, provided student welfare and
contractual issues are handled well. Students may also defer study, rather than not enrol
altogether, Education agencies are working with providers to consider mitigations, like
different delivery methods, to manage short-term disruptions to study.

14. Education agencies will determine the impacts on provider viability and on the wider market.
The impact is hard to read at this stage and likely to depend on how New Zealand's
reputation holds during our management of the situation and how long the situation is in
place. There will be taxation and labour market impacts depending on the scale of the effect
on export earnings.

45. Officials are in the early stages of assessing the impacts on education markets in China, for
example, China-based campuses of New Zealand education providers and broader off-shore
delivery. As education agencies gather evidence and impacts on this, it will be included in
international education economic analysis.

Primary Exports

16. Most primary sectors are experiencing some disruption to their trade with China including
issues with supply chains, delayed payments, cancelled orders, and cessation of some
airfreight services. Lower consumer confidence will likely affect overall consumer spending
on high value products. Annex Two provides a brief summary of export trade to China for key

primary sectors.

. Seafood: The seafood industry is concerned about holding product in the water and

the lack of cold storage space. This product is likely to be diverted to other lower value
markets in the short-term. Aside from the live rock lobster industry, the main
airfreighted seafood product is chilled salmon. Chilled salmon accounts for less than
1% of seafood exports on average in February. Industry has indicated it will likely stop
chilled salmon exports until there is more certainty around border clearance processes
and timeframes in China.
