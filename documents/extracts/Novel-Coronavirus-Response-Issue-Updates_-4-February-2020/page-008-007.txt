Table 2: Composition of Chinese visitors to New Zealand (YE June 2019)

5. Individual tourism operators, and their ability to respond and offset, will vary depending on
their particular circumstances. Some will redirect their activities to other markets, albeit in
some cases by lowering prices to encourage take up of unused capacity and experiencing
some reduced profitability as a result. Others will cater solely for the Chinese market, and
their resilience will depend on how they have managed the profits from the last 8 years of
growth.

6. | Westpac have estimated that the travel ban from China to New Zealand will reduce quarterly
GDP by 0.4 per cent if it lasts two months. This is based on a scenario in which seasonally
adjusted visitor arrivals to New Zealand drop by 11 per cent over the coming three months’.

How are government agencies supporting the Tourism sector?

7. The Visitor Sector Emergency Advisory Group (VSEAG)’, chaired by MBIE Tourism, has
reconvened and will meet regularly for the foreseeable future. Members include
representatives from Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA) and Regional Tourism New Zealand,
the international airports, as well as government agencies. A primary role for VSEAG at this
time is to foster timely and accurate communication flows to the tourism sector, and to
connect health authorities to useful resources in the tourism sector.

8. Aparticular focus at present is to ensure Chinese visitors already in New Zealand will be
able to travel home. Industry associations advise that they have not had any reports of
Chinese visitors facing difficulties in returning home. Industry associations report that airlines
are going out of their way to enable rerouting and ensuring they can get sufficient aircraft to
NZ to enable travel for their customers. TIA has had some reports of visitors wishing to
extend their stay in NZ and not return to China in light of health concerns. These individuals
are being advised to contact Immigration New Zealand (INZ) directly.

9.  VSEAG is undertaking a number of actions to support the tourism sector at this time. These
include:

a. MBIE, Tourism NZ (TNZ) and TIA developing key messages for the media on the
impact on tourism at the national level, to encourage a flow of accurate information and
mitigate the burden on key tourism operators who may be approached for comment by
multiple media outlets.

b. Connecting the Ministry of Health (MoH) with social media operated by the tourism
sector, including by TNZ and ATEED. These include Chinese-language channels
which can provide effective means of communicating information to Chinese visitors in
New Zealand.

c. Helping Regional Tourism Organisations and operators in the regions to access key
messages from MoH and to know who to contact and work with in the event of visitors
to their regions becoming unwell.

‘ Westpac’s assumption is that NZ receive zero visitor arrivals from China for two months, followed by the

half the usual number in the third month, and that arrivals from the rest of Asia are reduced by 20%.

2 VSEAG facilitates communication and co-ordination in response to adverse events, where visitors are

affected. In the last year this has included events such as the Christchurch mosque attack, Whakaari White

Island eruption, and West Coast flooding (we are currently monitoring the Milford situation as well).
