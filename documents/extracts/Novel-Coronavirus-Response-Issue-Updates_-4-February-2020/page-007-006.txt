Potential Implications for the Economy

14. At this stage, it is not possible to accurately determine the implications of the Coronavirus
outbreak. Noting that the situation is fluid and there are many unknowns, this is a high-level
summary of potential impact.

Tourism impacts

2. Chinese tourists spend about $1.7 billion in New Zealand each year (about 0.6 per cent of
New Zealand's annual GDP). Chinese visitors account for around 12 per cent of all tourists
to New Zealand and 15 per cent of all tourist expenditure. For context, during the SARS
outbreak in 2003, Chinese visitors made up about 3 per cent of all tourists and 3 per cent of
tourist expenditure in New Zealand.

3. Some regions attract more Chinese tourists, and will be more impacted than others. For
example, Chinese visitor spend in February is concentrated in Auckland (25 per cent of all
Chinese spend), Queenstown (22 per cent) and Rotorua (14 per cent). The outbreak has
also occurred over Chinese New Year, so affects a peak visitation period.

around half of all Chinese visits and visitor spending.
