significant revenue from Chinese visitors (e.g. certain tour operators), for others the impact
will not be obvious but nonetheless significant (e.g. fuel stations)

Next steps

21. Given the uncertainty and fluid nature of the situation, MBIE has set-up a dedicated team
within MBIE to monitor developments and assess the economic impact. Treasury have also
stood up the multi-agency Economic Advisory Group (EAG) to support ODESC. EAG is the
coordinating point for advising ODESC on the economic (and financial system) impacts of
acute events such as the coronavirus outbreak. We are looking to provide Ministers with a
further paper tomorrow, providing system advice on economic monitoring (including
information on what Australia is considering) and a framework for the consideration of any
government intervention.
