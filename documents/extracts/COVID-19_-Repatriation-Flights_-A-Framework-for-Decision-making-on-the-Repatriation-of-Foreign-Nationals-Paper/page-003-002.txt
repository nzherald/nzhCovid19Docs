(v)Practical Arrangements. Arranging repatriation flights is a complex and
resource intensive exercise. Foreign governments must take responsibility for
ensuring all health and logistical arrangements are in place and to the
satisfaction of relevant authorities before flights will be approved.

4 As second order issues, it is worth noting that chartered aircraft being brought
into New Zealand by foreign governments could be used to bring home our nationals.
Those aircraft could also be used for air freight of essential supplies, including
pharmaceuticals. However, taking advantage of freight opportunities will require
longer timelines for repatriation flights of foreign nationals.

5 We do not yet have arrangements and systems in place to manage government
sponsored assisted departures against our Level 4 restrictions; and the government
is facing high operational demands in other areas. We suggest therefore that foreign
governments be told we may be in a position to facilitate managed departures from
the point at which commercial options dry up - i.e. after 1 April.

Consultation

6 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade drafted this paper. The Ministries of
Health, Transport, Education and MBIE have commented on this paper, and agree
with its overall direction.

Recommendations

7 We recommend that you:

7.1 Note that we are encouraging New Zealanders overseas and foreign
nationals in New Zealand to “shelter in place” unless they have secured
arrangements to depart, but that options for assisted departures are
being kept under review.

7.2 Agree that no assisted departures of foreign nationals in New Zealand
should occur for the remainder of March 2020.
