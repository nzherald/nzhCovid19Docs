be facilitated in a way that minimises the further spread of the virus (see
below).

b. Judgements also need to be informed by a view on whether foreign
nationals are more likely to fail to comply with the Level 4 requirements
or in other ways place disproportionate pressure on our systems.

(ii) Shelter in place. To prevent further spread of COVID19, our overriding national
priority is shutting down the movement of people within New Zealand. An
exception to our shelter-in-place policy should only be countenanced where
foreign nationals can move within New Zealand subject to conditions that
minimise the risk of further spread of the virus. Operational plans in place to
support incoming commercial flights would need to be adapted for government-
sponsored assisted departures to ensure:

a. Assurances that assisted departure flights or certain passengers on
these flights are not going to be turned around and returned to
New Zealand;

b. Protection from virus transmission for staff and other New Zealanders
involved in supporting assisted departures; and

c. Preventing inadvertent spread during movements to airports of
departure by foreign nationals, e.g. by requiring individuals to test
asymptomatic prior to movement.

(iii) Scarce resources. With the public service stretched to deliver
operationally, the work of managing these flights would need to be done against
the backdrop of many other competing demands. We would need a clear
operational view that this work could be prioritised and sustained at the pace
expected of those foreign governments seeking to sponsor assisted
departuress6(a), s6(b)

(iv) Foreign policy. Foreign governments have an expectation of assisted
departures. They are seeking to undertake them in other jurisdictions â€” and we
are keeping a watching brief for opportunities for our nationals to avail
themselves of such flights.
