7.3 Agree that officials should, by 1 April, report back to COVID Ministers
with a framework for considering foreign governmentsâ€™ requests to
approve and support repatriation flights.

7.4 Agree that key principles in operationalising managed departures by
foreign nationals that would need to be met would include:

- That managed departures are assessed not to increase the
burden on the New Zealand public health system.

- That any movements must be managed in a way that minimises
the risk of the further spread of COVID19 within New Zealand.

- That resources could be allocated by the New Zealand
Government to manage assisted departures without taking away
from higher priorities.

- That foreign governments can prove all health and logistical
arrangements are in place and to the satisfaction of relevant New
Zealand authorities.

7.5 Agree that we advise foreign governments to suspend planning for
government chartered repatriation flights departing New Zealand before
1 April and until such time as a framework is in place.

7.7 :

7.8 Note that, should we agree to assisted departures by foreign
governments, the inwards flights may present opportunities to repatriate
New Zealanders from overseas and to bring in essential supplies via air
freight.
