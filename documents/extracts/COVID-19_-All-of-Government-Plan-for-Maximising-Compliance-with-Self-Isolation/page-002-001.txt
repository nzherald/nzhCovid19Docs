COVID-19: ALL OF GOVERNMENT PLAN

To Ad Hoc Cabinet Committee on COVID-19 Response
From All of Government Group Date [__yosi2020:

Purpose

1 This paper provides an overview of the all-of-government approach to
maximising compliance with COVID-19, and seeks agreement to this approach.

Key points

1 Work is underway to maximise compliance with self-isolation:

1.1. This includes immediate deployment of operational resource, including
monitoring visits;

1.2. Officials are, in parallel, scaling up and strengthening processes and
communications across government to maximise compliance with self-
compliance.

2 For self-isolation to work in New Zealand, it needs to be socially-driven and
communhity-supported. The intent is to manage the welfare of individuals and the
overall wellbeing of the country by not spreading COVID-19. In the vast majority
of cases, people want to do the right thing, but they need help knowing exactly
what to do. Enforcement action should be reserved for what we expect to be the
minority of people who refuse to comply with the government's requirement that
they self-isolate.

3 The all-of-government strategy is set out in Appendix One and is based on the
following approach to actions over the next month to maximise the contribution of
self-isolation to stop the spread of COVID-19:

3.1. inform and educate people on when and how to self-isolate, and monitor
their compliance;

3.2 provide support for those people want to self-isolate but need assistance
to do so at home;

3.3. manage isolation for those people who are not able to do so for
themselves at home; and
