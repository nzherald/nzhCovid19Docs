Provision of Financial Support to Local Authorities to Assist in the

Response to COVID-19

The group of Ministers with Power to Act on COVID-19 matters [CAB-20-MIN-0130] convened

on 26 March 2020 at 10.30am, and in accordance with their Power to Act:

1 noted that the role of Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) Groups in a
New Zealand pandemic response includes the provision of services and any other resources
necessary to support the health-led pandemic response, including coordinated delivery of
emergency welfare services and resources to affected individuals, families, whanau and
communities;

2 noted that the Guide to the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan 2015 (the
Guide) makes provision for local authorities to be fully reimbursed for costs incurred in
caring for displaced people;

3 noted that, as currently written, the Guide does not provide for any costs incurred in
providing welfare support to people who are meeting COVID-19 self-isolation or home
confinement requirements, thereby creating a potential constraint on the ability of CDEM
Groups and local authorities to effectively undertake their role as outlined in paragraph 1
above;

4 agreed to amend the Guide to enable the provision of government financial support to local
authorities for costs they incur in providing welfare support to people who are self-isolating
or who are confined at home, under measures taken as part of the COVID-19 pandemic
response, particularly at COVID-19 Alert Levels 3 and 4;

5 noted that the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response
means it is not possible to identify the potential fiscal implications of this amendment;

6 agreed that this amendment will apply specifically to the current COVID-19 pandemic
response, thereby ensuring clear parameters for its application, and helping manage potential
fiscal implications;

7 directed the Director, Civil Defence Emergency Management to amend and re-issue the
Guide to reflect the decisions made in paragraph 4 above;

8 noted that government financial support to local authorities for costs incurred is usually
provided through reimbursement on the basis of expense claims, with provision in the Guide
to make advance payments if large amounts of expenditure are anticipated;
