Security Level — Commercial In Confidence

5. | The most promising options available are to encourage retail channels that
remain open under COVID Level 4 to use more domestic pork and increasing
retail channels (opening up butchers). These are discussed in further detail
below.

Encourage retail channels that remain open to use more domestic pork

(Supermarkets and food processors)

6. Pork and pork products imported in 2019 were 70.6 million kgs CWE" worth $NZ
213 million (equivalent to over 15,600 pigs per week). In 2019, NZ’s major pork
importing partners were Spain, Canada, US, and Finland. The majority of pork
was imported as frozen products (either as chilled or frozen in unprocessed and
uncooked formats). Anecdotal advice suggests imported product is sourced from
overseas for:

o convenience - it is pre-cut and carton-ed meaning the food processor don’t
have to do their own cutting;

© consistency — the food processors need a lot of particular parts of the pig; and

o price — imported pork is about 60% to 80% of the cost of domestic pork.

7. Given the volume and nature of the imports, the vast majority of imported pork is
being used in small goods manufacturing - Heller’s notes the vast majority of the
pork they use is imported, with 95% of the pork bellies they use for streaky bacon
being imported. They use pork belly volume of approximately 70 tonnes/week (or
bellies from 12,500 pig carcasses).
