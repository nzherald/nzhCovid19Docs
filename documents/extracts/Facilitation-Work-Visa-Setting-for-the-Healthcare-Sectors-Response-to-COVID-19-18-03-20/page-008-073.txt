24. Delaying the stand-down period until the end of 2020 gives employers time to mainta
workforces while the COVID-19 response rolls out. This lead time needs to take into
the time taken to find and recruit a worker, as well as processing times for Essential
visas.

25. Affected visa holders would then need to apply for a new temporary visa, which wou
valid for the period following the expiry of the original visa, until 31 December 2020. T
could not be operationalised through the roll-over of current visa status; the applican
need to apply for a new visa and would be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This a
ensures the applicant is able to return home if desired.

26. To facilitate this process as far as possible, we propose that most visa requirements
waived: for example, the requirement for a labour market test (including a skills matc
with the Ministry of Social Development) and possibly health and character checks.

27. Ifyou agree, a Cabinet decision would be required.

28. Implications for the partners of these workers will also need to be thought through. W
lower-skilled Essential Skills visa holders are not currently able to support partners o
dependents, some will be currently supporting partners/dependents if they were alre
New Zealand as at August 2017 due to transitional instructions which were put in pla
that time.

29. From July 2020, a further change under the reforms to the employer-assisted tempo
work visa will be implemented that will allow any lower-skilled Essential Skills work v
holder to support a partner for a visitor visa, and a dependent child for a student or v
visa. If you agree to delay the stand-down for affected workers, consideration will ne
given to whether their partners and dependents are also eligible to come to New Zea
the period.

If an Epidemic Management Notice is declared, the need to delay the stand-down pe

be superseded

30. When an Epidemic Notice is in force, the use of special powers by government agencies are
enabled through an Epidemic Management Notice (EMN). With agreement from the Minister
of Immigration, the Prime Minister may issue an EMN through the Gazette stating the
relevant powers in the Immigration Act 2009 have been invoked to deal with the prac
effects of the outbreak. The powers enable the relaxation of some statutory requirem
including automatically extending the expiry date of expiring visas until after three mo
from when the EMN expires for visas expiring before and for 14 ore i(Umm aoM CUTE
EMN.

31. If this is the case, the stand-down period will be superseded and affected migrant wo
will be able to remain in New Zealand.

32. Officials are preparing advice on the costs and benefits of issuing an EMN and invok
relevant immigration powers, should an Epidemic Notice be put into force.

Immigration settings could also be facilitative for offshore w

necessary for the health response to COVID-19

33. The Ministry of Health has advised us that seeking health professionals from overseas is not
the preferred option for addressing current workforce pressures. This is due to the global
nature of COVID-19 and the need for healthcare workforces worldwide, as well as due to the
self-isolation requirements for those coming to New Zealand. However, fast-tracking visa
processing for applications which are already in train for medical workers could be an feyejitey al
worth pursuing.
