oF n addition, the New Zealand Aged Care Association (NZACA) wrote to the Prime Mi
10 March asking that the Government “suspend the three-year stand down policy
immediately” as part of a broader request for Government support of the Aged Resid
Care (ARC) sector to respond to COVID-19. You are meeting with the CEO of NZAC
Simon Wallace, on 19 March 2020 and he is likely to discuss this topic.

ho is affected by the stand-down period?

9.  MBIE estimates that the total number of individuals, across all occupations on Essen
Skills visas affected by the stand-down from September 2020 to February 2021 is
approximately 1,241.

10. Of this, MBIE data suggests that only a small number of caregivers, 37 Aged or Disa
Carers and 38 Personal Care Assistants (the main roles under the “caregiver” job
description), are estimated to be affected by the stand-down period from September
February 2021. The stand-down period will start to affect larger numbers of workers
sector from March 20211.

11. Note that this data is approximate — given the difficulty in tracking workers’ visas acro
three-year period there is a risk that there is an element of under-estimation. The dat
does not take into account the partners of Essential Skills visas holders in other sect
if they are lower-paid, will have to leave New Zealand when the stand-down period a
taking their partner, who has been working in the aged care sector, with them. We kn
roughly 5.4% of the entire aged care workforce (including domestic workers) are on
Skills visas, with 6.6% on “other” work visas (likely partnership).

12. From July 2020, the first set of changes under the reforms to the employer-assisted
temporary work visa system will be implemented. This includes moving to using the national
median wage (currently $25.50) to determine those who are subject to the stand down period
and those who are not. It is uncertain how many employers will agree to lift their wages in
order to be eligible to apply for a visa that is not subject to the stand down policy. Given that
the government is the primary funder to aged care services, it may not be possible for all
aged residential care providers to increase their wages without seeking additional funding
from government. However, we understand that a number of other industries are actively
looking at making changes to enable this (prior to the impacts of COVID-19 being felt across
the domestic economy).

13. The NZACA’s own estimates as to numbers of workers affected by the stand-down a
higher - they estimate (based on surveys) that approximately 1,700 workers will be |i
the stand-down period this year. We have reviewed the material made available ovata)
NZACA and have identified several reasons why this number may be overstated:

a. _ This industry’s figures are, in part, based on the number of temporary workers starting
in or before August 2017, however the stand-down period only applies to temporary
workers whose visa was applied for and decided after 28 August 2017 — itis the first
visa after this point which begins the three-year count. It is likely that industry’s figures
are over-counting as they include those workers who were already on a visa in August
2017.

It is possible that the industry’s data is based on the entire migrant workforce, but the
stand down period only applies to those on Essential Sk] ~
