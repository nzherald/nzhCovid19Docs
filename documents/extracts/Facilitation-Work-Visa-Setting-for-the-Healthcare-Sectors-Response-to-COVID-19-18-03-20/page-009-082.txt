34. A list of professions needed to supplement the healthcare workforce for the response
provided at Annex One, noting that the entirety of the health sector could come unde
pressure as practitioners self-isolate or become sick â€” that is, there could be shortag
other areas such as Midwives, Surgeons and Mental Health Workforces. These roles
needed to ensure there is not additional pressure put on already stretched hospitals.
Because of this, it may be most practical to fast-track visa processing for the entire h
workforce. Most of these roles are higher-skilled and higher-paid and so would not be
to the stand-down period.

35. In terms of priority processing for residents, residence applications are already priorit
people with a job offer and paid above $104,000, so doctors and nurses and other m
professions which have occupational registration are already covered by the prioritisa
eld ates

36. Temporary work applications for highly-paid roles and occupations requiring registrat
also prioritised, which covers most key healthcare roles. However, it could be made e
that certain occupations will be prioritised.

Next steps

37. If you agree, and subject to further work on implementation, officials will prepare a C
paper on the stand-down period for the CVD committee on Wednesday 25 March.

38. Officials will undertake further work to develop processes around other issues that ar
raised, such as workers who may become stranded here due to travel restrictions in
countries, or sector-specific requests.

39. Immigration New Zealand will prepare proactive messaging for employers based your
decisions.
