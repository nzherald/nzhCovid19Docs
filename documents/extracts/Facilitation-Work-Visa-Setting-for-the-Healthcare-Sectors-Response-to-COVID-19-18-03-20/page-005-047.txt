A range of industry and employer stakeholders are calling for

facilitative immigration settings in light of COVID-19

1. | Anumber of industries, including aged care and tourism, have raised concerns abou
impact of COVID-19 on their migrant workers and have asked for specific changes to
and operational settings to support affected employers and workers.

2. _ Given that the impacts of COVID-19 are likely to include a softening of the labour ma
(and hence greater domestic labour supply), when considering any changes to work
settings, our starting principle is to ensure a ‘New Zealanders first’ approach and toe
that the immigration system works in concert with the skills/employment and welfare
systems. For example, work is underway across government to look at options for m
workers who may lose their job in one sector to opportunities that Mare Wa Sloe WC tcle)t-mi a
sectors. We need to ensure that any changes to immigration settings in the short term
not undermine the objectives sought by such work.

ce However, there may be some industries and occupations that have a key role to play
COVID-19 response (e.g. healthcare and medical staff) where maintaining existing d
workforces and enhanced facilitation for offshore workforces would be of benefit.

4. Wewill consider the case for more facilitative settings over the short-term — as the response
plays out - based on the following criteria:

e Extent to which the occupation is necessary for the public health response or continuation
of vital infrastructure services (and in light of the scale of affected workers)

e Extent to which the industry is experiencing significant business impacts as a result of
COVID-19, and what else the government is doing for these sectors which would also
mitigate impacts

¢ Impacts on New Zealanders - for example, whether the role be filled by a displaced New
Zealander in the context of softening labour market conditions.

oF Initial analysis indicates that more facilitative settings for temporary workers could include the
following:

and will provide you with further advice on this.

7. The Ministry of Health has provided MBIE with a list of occupations relevant to the response
which could be considered for other facilitative work visa settings (see Annex One), noting
that it may be more practical to prioritise visa processing for the entire health workforce,
given that shortages in any areas would put pressure on the system as a whole.
