Purpose
To seek your agreement to more facilitative immigration settings in the short-term for healt
workers (including in the aged care sector), given their key role in supporting the response
COVID-19.
Executive summary
A number of employer and industry groups have raised questions in relation to temporary work
visa settings in terms of both the response to COVID-19 and the flow on business impacts of the
evolving COVID-19 situation. We recommend that any consideration of options for changes to
temporary work visa settings in the medium and longer term need to be made with a deeper
understanding of how and what labour market impacts will emerge, and under the general labour
market principle of ‘New Zealanders first’. Officials will provide you with further advice on these
matters as we develop a better understanding of the labour market situation, which will take
account not only options within the immigration system, but also the skills/employment and welfare
systems and the impacts of the Government's recently announced Business Support Package.
In the short term, however, we consider that there is a case for some changes to temporary work
visa settings to ensure that they are not a barrier to achieving the government's goals of preparing
the health sector to respond to COVID-19. Work visa settings have a role to play in maintaining the
existing workforce, as well as facilitating access to a global workforce (should health sector
employers decide that is in the best interests for the response).
Maintaining onshore health workforce
The stand-down period, due to kick-in from 28 August 2020, is aimed at preventing a pool of lower-
skilled, lower-paid foreign workers building up in New Zealand, who are well-settled but have no
pathway to residence. As part of the reforms to employer-assisted temporary work visas, Cabinet
has agreed to use the national median wage (currently $25.50) to distinguish between those who
are subject to the stand-down and those who are not. This change is planned to be implemented
from July 2020. Approximately 1,241 workers in total are subject to the stand down from
September 2020 to February 2021 — however a number of these people may be paid over the
median wage and therefore eligible to apply for a new visa that enables them to stay.
The Ministry of Health has provided the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)
with list of occupations relevant to the response (see Annex One), which include both higher-paid
workers (who will generally be able to remain onshore, if they wish) and lower-paid workers (who
will be subject to the stand down policy). The latter category includes caregivers in the health and
aged care workforce. ;
We consider that there is a case for a limited suspension of the stand-down period for healthcare
workers, including caregivers, in the interests of minimising disruption to the public health response
to COVID-19. A limited suspension would give the industry time respond to COVID-19 and plan
