APPENDIX TWO
Memo describing the extension of State of National Emergency, to be
provided to the House together with a copy of the signed extension
form.
To: Clerk of the House, and the leader of each political party
CC: Bills Office
From: Hon Peeni Henare, Minister Civil Defence
For immediate presentation to the House
Please see attached a declaration extending the current State of National Emergency (due to
COVID-19) signed by Hon Peeni Henare, Minister Civil Defence, at TIME/ DATE. This extension
comes into force at 12.21 pm on Wednesday, 15 April 2020 and will expire at 12.21 pm on
Wednesday, 22 April 2020, unless terminated earlier. There is no limit as to how many times a
State of National Emergency may be extended.
This extension has been made on the advice of the Director of Civil Defence Emergency
Management, and after consultation with the Prime Minister. The effect of the declaration is that
the control of the response to COVID-19 will be managed at the national level and will ensure
local and regional level compliance with instructions issued. The aim is to ensure the health
system capacity is not exceeded through strengthening public health measures and supporting
the enforcement of COVID-19 interventions to reduce and eliminate sustained and intensive
transmission of the disease.
The State of National Emergency and the COVID-19 alert levels are two distinct and separate
things. The alert levels specify the range of measures that we are taking against COVID-19. A
State of National Emergency provides the people managing the response in an emergency, in
this case COVID-19, access to powers they would not normally have, but require now to
implement and enforce these measures.
