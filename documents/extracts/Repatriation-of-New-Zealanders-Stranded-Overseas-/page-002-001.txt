6 noted that the operationalisation of the repatriations will continue to be undertaken by
MFAT, in consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs where a Ministerial decision is
required;
7 noted that careful sequencing and coordinated planning of repatriation flights will be
required to manage the impact on available capacity for managed isolation/quarantine, as
well as any potential flow-on impacts for the health system and the provision of other
services;
8 noted that the decision not to prioritise repatriation for New Zealanders in low-risk
countries will be communicated publicly as soon as possible to encourage New Zealanders
to use commercial options to return home while they are still available;
9 noted that
9.1 applying this prioritisation approach, MFAT estimates that the cost of repatriation
charter flights is likely to be in the order of $10-$14 million;

9.2 this would be reprioritised from within Vote Foreign Affairs baseline through a joint
Ministers process, by way of a fiscally neutral output expense transfer to increase the
Consular appropriation.
