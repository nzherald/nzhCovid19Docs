necessarily have to use this process (for a visa or a variation of conditions) to travel to New
Zealand. Using this process provides them benefits of certainty. These people may continue
to attempt to travel to New Zealand by presenting themselves at check-in. In these cases,
where an airline refers the traveller to INZ, a border officer will make a case-by-case

person seeking travel can then be referred to the proposed process as an alternative

defined guidance material across all categories. This will support officers in the
decision making process and result in consistent outcomes.

considered on a case by case basis for certain persons, including individuals with a
humanitarian reason to enter New Zealand. Guidance material was drafted to support
officers when determining whether to grant entry permission as an exception for
humanitarian reasons. Factors to consider include:

e the applicants connection to New Zealand;
