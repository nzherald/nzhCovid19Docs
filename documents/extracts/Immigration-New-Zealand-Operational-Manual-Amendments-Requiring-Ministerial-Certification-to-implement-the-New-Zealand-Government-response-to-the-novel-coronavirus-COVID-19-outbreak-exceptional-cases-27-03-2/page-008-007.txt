The proposed new approach

24. Amore consistent approach with the broader immigration framework is to allow decision;
making about exceptions to be done as part of a visa or variation of conditions application
assessment (visas decisions made offshore, as opposed to onshore entry permission)»

25. Immigration staff will vet these requests and those that are considered likely to. meét the high
exceptions thresholds will be asked to provide sufficient information to. asses them against
requirements, Consequently, they will either be issued with a visitor visa or @Variation of
conditions with a special ‘code’ that border ICT systems will recognisefas being an exception
and be given permission to board the flight to New Zealand. Thé visa,oPVariation will in effect
be the technical system's ‘green-light’ to travel to New Zealand:

26. Allowing consideration of exceptions to take place in a visayOrgvatiation of conditions
application provides a transparent framework fordecision making, rather than requiring
border officers to make a discretionary decision. undersignificant time constraints. This will
provide greater certainty to those individuals seeking to travel to New Zealand under one of
the agreed exceptions. Individuals who are holding @visa granted as a result of this
proposed process, or who hold a valid temporary visa with the condition that they have a
critical purpose to travel to New Zealaid, faust be granted entry permission to New Zealand.
These changes will also ensure thatthe decision making takes place in a more legally robust
way within a supported consideration process.’

27. This process has operationalbenefits for INZ as requests for an exception to the travel
restrictions are more likelyto béteceived in advance of the check-in process. This allows the
applicant to provide more,releyant information and the immigration officer more time to make
a considered decision*againsbthe criteria. It also means that most requests for exceptions
are able to be channelled|to one place.

28. It is proposed that people who meet one of the agreed exceptions to the travel restrictions
and who wishtto enter New Zealand may be granted a visa with a condition that they
specifically fulfil the purpose for which they were granted the exception to the travel
restriction. Reéple granted a visa or wha have their existing visa varied under this proposal
will also have a condition added that they must comply with any instruction from a Medical
Officer of Health which relates to a notifiable or quarantinable disease.

29. People granted a visa or variation under the proposed process who then travel to New
Zealand and are granted entry permission will be subject to isolation or quarantine on arrival
in accordance with Ministry of Health requirements.

30. People who contact INZ and appear to meet the criteria will be invited to apply for a visa with
the new condition (if they do not currently hold a visa). Only individuals who are invited to
apply will be eligible to submit an application under this category. People who meet one of
the agreed exceptions who hold a visa already may have their visa varied to confirm they can
travel to New Zealand. People may also be invited to apply following a representation to INZ
from a third-party, such as the Ministry of Health, the Associate Minister of Immigration or
other authorities, where an immigration officer is satisfied that the exception criteria are likely
to be met.
