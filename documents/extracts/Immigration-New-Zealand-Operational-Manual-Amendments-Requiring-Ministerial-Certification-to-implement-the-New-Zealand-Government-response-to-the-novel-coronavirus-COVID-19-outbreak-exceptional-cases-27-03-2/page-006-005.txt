The current approach has operational challenges

7. There are a large number of people outside New Zealand seeking consideration as an
exception. Some are attempting to check-in to a flight to New Zealand and are not allowed to
board. This is because either the airlines lack the resources to seek boarding permission
from INZ for the large numbers of people seeking exceptions, or because INZ is unable to
respond to the large number of requests, or because INZ is unwilling to consider a person
exceptional given the paucity of information available about their circumstances.

8. It's difficult to estimate the quantity of this demand, but in 2012 Statistics New Zealand
estimated there are between 600,000 to 1,000,000 New Zealanders (New Zealander-born
and New Zealand citizens) overseas. If 2% of these people have non-New Zealand Partners
and children there could be between 12,000 — 20,000 people seeking exemptions as’
partners and children travelling with a New Zealand citizen or resident. 2% is a rough
estimate of the percentage of non-New Zealanders on international flights thaénter NeW
Zealand (when these flights are available). The number of marginal cases where people
expect an exception to be made (and thus may attempt to board a flight toe New Zéaland or
make contact with INZ) is likely to be higher.

9. Other exemptions grounds include essential health workers, otheresséntial workers and for
humanitarian reasons. The number of requests for these peoplé tobe Considered
exemptions is difficult to estimate though given the relativelyahight number of New Zealanders
with close family overseas, this group is likely to be largey

10, People who are unsuccessful attempting to board/a flight to. New Zealand, or who seek some
certainty before attempting to travel to New Ze@land/are.attempting to contact INZ for
assurance. These requests are being made to Mittisters, senior officials at INZ MBIE, to the
Immigration Contact Centre and through any other @hannel available.

11. The large number of requests createstextrasand unnecessary work for these officials at a
time they are required to respond to.systemic issues, rather than case-by-case decisions.
Even where an official is satisfied thatya pefsor has an exceptional case that meets the
criteria set by the Government, thatiperson has no way to access or influence discretionary
decision making by a bordenofficer (nor should they). Where a special case can be justified,
the government agent can*equésbthat you, as the Minister of Immigration, make a special
direction granting entry permission to a particular person or group of people.

12. This process is time*consuming and may not be the best use of time for officials. Even in
cases where a spétialdifection is made, the person concerned will still be refused
permission to bodrd Unless the airline they are travelling with agrees in their case to contact
INZ so boafdifig permission can be granted as a special case. Ensuring boarding for these
people fequires further work by the official wha is championing their cause, and additional
work for border officials who must then override the automatic direction to prevent the person
from boatding.

The current approach is difficult and uncertain for people who meet the exceptions criteria

13. The current approach requires people to attempt to board a plane en route to New Zealand
in order to be considered as an exception. People will only know if they have been
considered as an exceptional case once they are checking in, arguably at a very late stage
after considerable time and expense. This is problematic for several reasons. For those who
do meet the exceptions criteria, they have no assurance until after the travel has been
booked, paid for, and are checking in. The current process does not provide access to pre-
vetting a traveller to check that they meet the exceptions criteria in advance of travel.

14. In some instances, people who believe they meet the exceptions criteria have sought
assistance from various officials (from all levels of Immigration New Zealand, Ministers and
