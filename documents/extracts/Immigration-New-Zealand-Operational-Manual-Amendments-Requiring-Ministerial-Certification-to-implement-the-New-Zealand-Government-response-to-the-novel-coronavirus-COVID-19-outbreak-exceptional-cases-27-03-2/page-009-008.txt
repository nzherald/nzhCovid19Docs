Restricted temporary entry instructions

31. It is proposed that the immigration instructions setting out the criteria to be granted a special
visa or a variation of conditions be restricted temporary entry instructions. Restricted
temporary entry instructions place limits on the discretion that is normally allowed in
temporary entry decision-making, similar to the limits on discretion that exists in residence
decision-making. Immigration officers may not grant temporary visas as exceptions to
restricted temporary entry instructions. Restricted temporary entry provisions have not
previously been used in immigration decision making. The rationale for using restricted
temporary entry instructions in this case is that the limits on immigration officer discretion will
help signal that only certain, specified situations can be considered under these instmuctions,
and reduce pressure for a wide variety of ‘exceptions’ to be granted.

Process

32. _INZ will be able to quickly make a decision on whether the individual should be invited to
apply, and will be able to directly communicate the process and requirements with
applicants. INZ will also be able prioritise the request from people that meefthe most
important exceptions criteria (for example ‘essential health workers’ )/IN2Zjis iso
investigating a ‘silent decline’ process for people seeking an exceptiony whereby only those
with compelling cases will be invited to apply for a visa or VOC fand)the"Sthers not
responded to within a set period of time (for example 5 day$),willibe refused.

33. This process will quickly and efficiently provide certainty to,¢ligible individuals, and
concentrate immigration officer resources on applicahts Mostlikely to be considered an
exception.

34. Under the proposed instructions, a visitor visa may be granted to allow essential travel to
New Zealand. The visitor visa will be grantedfor sufficient time to achieve their critical
purpose in New Zealand, for up to sixmofAths However, if applicants have an acceptable
standard of health, and are not required to provide medical certificates they may be granted
a visitor visa valid for up to 12 months, Thisis intended to reduce the need for travellers who
meet the exceptions criteria to applyforfurther visas in New Zealand at a time when
immigration resources are under pressure. A further visa could be applied for once the holder
is in New Zealand if necessary.

35. Essential workers, on€Ssential health workers may be granted a visitor visa that allows them
to work for any employer in New Zealand. If they are supported by a Government agency
and are key to the‘COWID-19 response, they may be granted a work visa for up to 24
months. These allowances are intended to support health agencies and other essential
services by*previding greater certainty about the overseas worker coming to assist with the
COVID response.

36. git is ‘also‘proposed that people invited to apply for either a visitor visa or a VOC are not
reglired to pay the application fee, immigration levy, or the international visitor and
conservation levy. These are people who have already been screened to establish that they
are likely to meet one of the exceptions criteria, and have compelling reasons to travel to
New Zealand. INZ is not easily able to receive fees for these applications. All applicants will
be outside New Zealand, and immigration officers would be required to obtain credit-card
information over the telephone (as credit card information can not be stored electronically if it
is not secured, such as in an email). Over-time, if it was desired, an electronic form and a
payment gateway could be created to allow fees to be received legally and efficiently.

37. We recommend that you consider waiving the fees and levies for both visitor visa
applications and applications for variations of conditions made under the proposed process
and new restricted immigration instructions. We will prepare further advice giving you the
option of making a special direction to waive fees and immigration levies for invited
