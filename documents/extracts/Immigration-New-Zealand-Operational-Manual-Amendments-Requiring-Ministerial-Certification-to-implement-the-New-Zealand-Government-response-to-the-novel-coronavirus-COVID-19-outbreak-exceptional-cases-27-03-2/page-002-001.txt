Purpose
This paper seeks that you agree to and certify proposed changes to _i (ori lon instructions to
support the decisions made on 19 March 2020, by Ministers with Po wy, 6 AGt, to expand Category
1A countries to include the rest of the world and restrict any person‘from coming to New Zealand,
unless excluded [CAB 20 MIN 0122]. This decision establi everal categories of people
exempt including a humanitarian category with a high bar f |. This proposal also allows
for the imposition of the condition on any existing te lass visa that the holder adhere
to any instructions of a Medical Officer of Health.
These changes are recommended to achieve thre@\objectives: to manage the legal risks
associated with the current approach to exceptions; to provide a more transparent process for
travellers; and to enable Immigration Ne to operationally manage the large number of
exceptions being sought. Overall, the chan provide an enhanced framework to restrict people
coming to New Zealand, in line with Ca isions on the temporary border closure. There is
an option to remain with the status quo (¢onsideration of exceptions at the border), which may be
operationally manageable in oe. col diminishing opportunity to travel to New Zealand.
However it will not resolve the es or concerns of travellers about the transparency of the
process. XN
These changes contribute to lew Zealand Government response to the nove! coronavirus

Recomme tion
