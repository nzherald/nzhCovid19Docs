â€œThis initiative requires the

timeframes.

37 To implement these changes, | seek agreement to amend the Social Security Regulations
2018 under sections 441(1), 441(2)(c), 428(1) and 428(2)(g) of the Social Security Act 2018,
and make an Order in Council under section 15(1) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006
which will enable MSD to have the discretion to exempt specified recipients of Temporary
Additional Support (TAS), Jobseeker Support and Sole Parent Support from temporarily
having to reapply in exceptional circumstances.

38 Sections 441(1) and 441(2)(c) of the Social Security Act provides for regulations to be made
that allow MSD to specify circumstances in which MSD may consider an exemption from
expiry of any specified benefits (eg, Jobseeker Support and Sole Parent Support). Sections
428(1) and 428(2)(g) of the Act provides for regulations to be made that allow MSD to
prescribe the period or periods for which TAS may be granted.

39 Section 15(1) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act also enables the Governor-General, by
Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of the Crown responsible for
the administration of an enactment, to modify any requirement or restriction imposed by the
enactment. An Order in Council will be required to ensure that the proposed changes to TAS

proposed amendments to the Social Security Regulations 2018.
