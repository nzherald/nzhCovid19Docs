Cabinet paper: COVID-19: Tax measures

1. This report seeks your approval of the attached Cabinet paper (COVID-19: Tax
measures). This follows the draft Cabinet paper and corresponding report that we
provided to you yesterday (IR2020/139; T2020/616 refers).

2 The tax measures included in the Cabinet paper are:

2.1. Targeted remission of use of money interest; and
2.2. Expanding Inland Revenue’s information sharing powers to support the
response to COVID-19.

3. Officials will be reporting separately on potential provisional tax measures.

4. You agreed to seek policy approval for the two tax measures at the Ad Hoc Cabinet
Committee on COVID-19 (CVD) on Wednesday 18 March. You have also agreed
that, subject to CVD’s approval, the Minister of Revenue will be delegated authority
to introduce a bill containing the measures as soon as practicable. This will occur in
consultation with the Minister of Finance and the Leader of the House.

5s We will provide you with speaking notes for taking the paper through CVD next
week.

6. The Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers should be proactively
released with appropriate redactions at the time the bill is introduced in late March.
We expect that this will occur within the requisite 30 working days of Cabinet
making final decisions.
