Background

1. On 16 March 2020, Cabinet agreed that a condition be added to temporary entry class visas
which requires all visa holders to comply with instructions from a Medical Officer of Health
which relate to a notifiable or quarantinable disease [CAB-20-MIN-0112]. The new visa
condition is not specifically a condition on the visa holder to self-isolate.

2. While the new visa condition does not specifically require a person to self-isolate, people
arriving in New Zealand are being asked to self-isolate. If they choose to not self-isolate, a
Medical Officer of Health may then require the person to isolate or quarantine themselves
under the Health Act 1956. If they refuse they will be in breach of the new visa condition.

3. The new visa condition will apply from 18 March 2020 and will be imposed on all new
temporary entry class visas granted and include people who arrive in New Zealand as visa-
waiver travellers.

4. While the new visa condition will apply from 18 March, existing visas holders in New Zealand
may still be made liable for deportation under section 157 of the Act using the process as
referenced below (paragraph 9 onwards).

Extending the conditions to resident visa applicants, including

Australians

5. Officials are considering the implications of adding a condition to resident visas requiring the
holder to comply with instructions from a Medical Officer of Health which relate to a notifiable
or quarantinable disease, and will report back to the Minister of Immigration within the next
few days.

6. _ Residents with conditions on their visas cannot apply for citizenship and may not sponsor
some family members. Officials note that new conditions for resident visas also apply only to
resident visas applied for after the new condition was added to immigration instructions.
Additionally, the Act does not allow a condition to be added to a permanent resident visa.

7. Australian citizens and permanent residents of Australia generally apply for and are granted
a resident visa on arrival in New Zealand, regardless of their intended length of stay.

8. Australian citizens and permanent residents of Australia who are not normally resident in
New Zealand may have more difficulty in meeting a self-isolation requirement than those who
do have a home here.

Deportation liability if a person breaches the new visa condition

9. A temporary entry class visa holder may be made liable for deportation for cause under
section 157 of the Act, if the Minister or an immigration officer determines that there is
sufficient reason to deport them.

10. A sufficient reason includes, but is not limited to a breach of the personâ€™s visa conditions, in
this case not complying with an instruction from a Medical Officer of Health.

11. Ifa person is made liable for deportation under section 157, the person then has 14 days
from the date of the service of a deportation liability notice to give good reason why any
deportation should not proceed.

12. They do not have the right to the 14-day period to give good reason if they are an excluded
person, under section 15 or 16 of the Act.
