5 The vulnerabilities of the Pacific generally translate into vulnerabilities for MFAT’s
network of 10 posts in the region. The ability of our posts to service consular demands
and any COVID-19 response activities in their host country, while also keeping staff safe,
will be limited.
Background
6 This paper outlines current actions and proposed geographic priorities for
New Zealand assistance to the Pacific to support preparedness in the event of a COVID-19
outbreak. It should be considered alongside the prioritisation and resourcing decisions
underpinning New Zealand’s domestic response.
Comment
7 Pacific countries are expected to be more severely impacted by COVID-19
outbreaks than developed countries such as New Zealand, due to factors such as
s6(a) high levels of non-communicable diseases and associated health
complications as well as living conditions. Modelling done by Otago University also
suggests that Pacific populations in New Zealand would be disproportionately affected in
the event of a New Zealand outbreak (alongside Maori and elderly population groups). The
close connections between Pacific populations in New Zealand and out in the region mean
that our international response in the Pacific should be well aligned with our domestic
response.
Currently at “Keep it out”, but heading into transition
8 While we are seeing an increasing rate of testing for COVID-19 in Pacific countries,
no cases have yet been confirmed in the region as at 8 March. Urgent work by
New Zealand border sector agencies is under way to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 entering
the Pacific via transmission from New Zealand while we are still in the “keep it out” phase
for the region.
9 This work includes scenario planning for the management of aviation/maritime links
into the Pacific (including cruise ships), policy work considering the implications of border
measures applied by both New Zealand and Pacific partners s6(a)
and regular sharing of Ministry of Health communications with
Pacific counterparts. The collaboration with Pacific partners has been close, and much
appreciated.
10 As New Zealand and Australia move into the “stamp it out” phase to address
anticipated clustered outbreaks, we are working with the World Health Organisation to
encourage Pacific partners to increase their readiness to respond in the event of an
