recommended in this paper would help to mitigate some of the potential for
disproportionate impact on women in the region from COVID-19.

Disability perspective

37 The Pacific context presents challenges to persons with disabilities, with

vulnerability often reinforced by societal and cultural norms, economic disparity, and

susceptibility to natural disasters. An outbreak of COVID-19 in the region would likely be
similar to a natural disaster in terms of additional vulnerability for persons with disabilities.

The approach recommended in this paper would be in line with New Zealand’s long-

standing support for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Publicity

elements of New Zealand’s response during media interactions focused on COVID-19.

1. Note that Pacific countries are vulnerable to severe impacts from a COVID-19

the region remains highly variable.

system preparation.

resources within thes6(a)) envelope, keeping Cabinet updated as the support
package is rolled out.
