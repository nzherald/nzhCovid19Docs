Wider Risks |s6(a)|
s6(a)
There are broadly four types of inter-related economic risks. Government expenditure is
already starting to be stretched in order to respond to health sector preparation, additional
border controls, and other reprioritisation of resources being directed towards COVID-19
response and away from the provision of regular social services. This will be exacerbated,
potentially severely so, if COVID-19 cases are found in Pacific countries.
18 Domestic government revenue will be negatively impacted by reduced business
activity in countries from the slowdown in domestic, regional, and global economic
demand. This will further stretch government budgets in the absence of additional external
revenues.s6(a)|
19 Business activity, livelihoods, and jobs are also at serious risk in the region,
particularly in certain export sectors such as tourism, s6(a), $9(2)(9)(i)

Supply chains for certain imported critical goods
such as food, fuel, and medicines may be significantly disrupted, and for some more
vulnerable countries maybe even entirely cut off for a period, with potentially severe knock-
on effects relating to health, food, and economic-security.
