Vulnerabilities of New Zealand's offshore network in the Pacific
29 The combination of 86(€) health systems, small posts, and the s6(a host
governments all quickly call into question the viability of MFAT’s network of Posts in the
Pacific, six out of ten of which have four or fewer seconded staff. Setting aside business
as usual, their ability to service consular demands and any COVID-19 response activities
in their host countries, while also keeping staff safe, will be significantly constrained. In
addition, border restrictions imposed by their home countries may mean that they are
unable to travel to and from New Zealand. 86(a)
Consultation
30 The Ministry of Health, NZMAT, NZDF, the Treasury, MBIE (INZ), and the
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet were consulted on this paper, and concur with
its contents.
Financial implications
31 There will be no impact on the Crown’s operating balance resulting from approving
this paper. The proposed initiative would be funded from within the current Vote Official
Development Assistance baseline. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s ODA financial
delegations require Cabinet approval for activities above $25 million.
Human rights
32 If support, including emergency medical support, were not available for Tokelau,
the Cook Islands and Niue, there would be significant human rights implications for their
people as New Zealand citizens in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in those locations.
Without support, New Zealand’s responsibilities to support their right to life and security
would be significantly compromised.
33 A proactive approach to Pacific preparedness and response support will help to
mitigate the human rights impacts of COVID-19 that would be expected if there were
outbreaks in the Pacific. The approach recommended in this paper also supports
New Zealand’s International Human Rights Action. Plan 2019-2023, which recognises
human rights in the Pacific as a focus area for New Zealand’s international human rights
work.
Legislative implications
34 There are no legislative implications to this paper.
Regulatory impact analysis
35 A regulatory impact statement is not required.
