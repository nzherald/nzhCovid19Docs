WFF entitlement to Emergency Bene“t recipients on temporary visas could be
included in this Bill.

18 The amendment would apply from J April 2020 onwards.

We expect the fiscal costs of this to be minimal

19 We expect this change to cost about $500,000 over five years — there is some
variability to this figure based on the take-up of Emergency Benefit for people on
temporary visas who may become newly eligible for Emergency Benefit if a domestic
epidemic management notice is issued and the Minister of Social Development
approves changes to Emergency Benefit eligibility criteria. This will be a Benefits or
Related Expense and included in future forecasting updates.

Next steps

20 If you agree to the proposal, officials will include this amendment in the COVID-19
Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Bill, due to be passed
under urgency on 25 March 2020.
