Officials recommend that we do not create a region wide exemption for Pacific
citizens at this stage, but that we consider any requests on a case by case basis,

partners and communities in New Zealand, alongside continued vigilance to
ensure that we minimise the risk of nCoV transmission into New Zealand and the
wider region.
