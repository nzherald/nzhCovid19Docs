Amendments to Border Entry instructions

Proposed new immigration instructions

15. The following proposed changes to immigration instructions expand the temporary border
measures restricting entry into New Zealand by residence class visa holders where the visa
was granted offshore and the person is arriving in New Zealand for the first time, all
temporary entry class visa holders and visa-waiver travellers. This will be effective from
11:59pm 19 March 2020 until 11:59pm 31 March 2020, unless amended or revoked earlier.

16. Further immigration instructions will be provided for certification if this response needs to be
extended beyond 31 March 2020.

17. Proposed additions to immigration instructions are highlighted for ease of reference.
Deletions have not been highlighted. Highlighting will not appear in the published versions of
the amended Operational Manual.

Communication

18. The Immigration New Zealand website has been updated to reflect the proposed changes.
Carriers have also been updated.

19. Changes will be communicated to all staff, licensed immigration advisers and the general
public through the release of an amendment circular as soon as the new immigration
instructions are certified.
