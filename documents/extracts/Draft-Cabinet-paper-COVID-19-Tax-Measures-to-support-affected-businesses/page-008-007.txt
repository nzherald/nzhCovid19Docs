Regulatory Impact Assessment |
54. The Regulatory Impact Assessment requirements apply to the proposals |
recommended in this report. However, owing to the short time frame available to |
develop a response to the COVID-19 outbreak no impact analysis has been
prepared. The Treasury therefore recommends that a Supplementary Analysis
Report (SAR) is provided to Cabinet ahead of a Bill containing these proposals being
agreed and introduced. |
55. If the Bill containing these proposals goes to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on |
31 March 2020 a SAR on the proposals will be provided at that time.
56. If Cabinet instead delegates authority to the Minister of Revenue to introduce the
Bill as soon as practicable there will likely be no opportunity for a SAR to be provided
to Cabinet before introduction.
