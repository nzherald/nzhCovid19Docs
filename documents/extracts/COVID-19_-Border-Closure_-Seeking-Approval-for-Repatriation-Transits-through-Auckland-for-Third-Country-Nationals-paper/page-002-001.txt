announced a 72-hour transit window for third country nationals in New Zealand to fly via

windows to enable nationals in those regions to return to their home country:.
(i) a window up to 1500 Tuesday 23 March (NZT) to enable transit via New Zealand
to Australia for onward connection:
a. from the Pacific (approximately 300 individuals)
b. from South America (approximately 400 individuals);
(ii) a window of up to one week (Sunday 29 March) to enable transit via New Zealand:
c. from Australia to the United States for US nationals|s9(2)(b)(ii)
and to Canada for Canadian nationals |s9(2)(b)(ii)
d. from the Pacific for other nationals not transiting Australia to their home
