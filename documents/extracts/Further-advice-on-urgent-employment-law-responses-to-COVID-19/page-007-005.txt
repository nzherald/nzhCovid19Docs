17. We have not previously provided advice on this issue, but it was noted at the meeting that
this could be problematic because union rules typically require a face-to-face meeting for the
ratification of a collective agreement, which will not be possible under the current level 4
status.

18. We-consider that for collective bargaining which is already underway, the circumstances will
have changed substantially since they notified their employer of the intended ratification
procedure, and if it does involve in-person meetings, these will no longer be possible due to
the pandemic.

19. Therefore we recommend a modification to the requirements in the ER Act. The modification
would be that while an EN is in place, if the method/means by which the parties agreed to at
the beginning of the process is such that it requires parties to ratify in a way which is
impractical (e.g. in person), then allow the parties to agree other means in which to ratify.

Issue 3: Expiration of collective agreements during pandemic (s53)

20. Section 53 of the ER Act sets out that in the event that a collective agreement has expired, it
will continue in force for 12 months so long as the union or the employer initiated collective
bargaining before the collective agreement expired and for the purpose of replacing the
collective agreement.

21. When a collective agreement expires, section 61 sets out that each existing employee who
was covered by the expired collective employment agreement automatically has an individual
employment agreement based on the expired collective agreement (plus any additional
terms and conditions agreed previously). The employer and employee can agree to change
this individual employment agreement or negotiate a brand new individual employment
agreement. If a collective agreement later comes into effect, then union members will
automatically move off any individual employment agreement onto the collective agreement.

22. We understand moving employees from a collective to individual employment agreements is
not desirable from a union perspective. The negative consequences could include losing the
benefits of terms in the collective which are not strictly employment terms (e.g. union access
provisions), the 30-day rule would not apply to new employees, and it may be
disadvantageous tactically to bargain for a new collective rather than renegotiating a current
one.

We continue to see a need for more flexibility for the 12-month extension period ...

23. As previously advised, we have identified a need to provide an extension to the 12-month
period where collective agreements continue after the specified expiration date. We still
consider this change is required, so collective agreements do not expire during the pandemic
period when collective bargaining is not likely to be feasible.

24. $9(2)(h)

However, we do not think any changes are required to make initiation easier for

unions

25. At the meeting to discuss our previous advice, it was noted that the proposed modification
did not provide an extension of the term of an existing collective agreement for parties who
cannot initiate bargaining to renegotiate it.
