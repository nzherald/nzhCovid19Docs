Background

An Epidemic Notice has been issued

1. The Prime Minister issued an Epidemic Notice (EN) on 23 March 2020. An Epidemic Notice
(EN) is a vehicle for introducing a broader range of powers on a national scale. Under the
Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 (EPA), the Prime Minister may issue an EN on
recommendation of the Director-General of Health, and must be satisfied that the effects of
an outbreak of a quarantinable disease are likely to significantly disrupt (or continue to
disrupt) essential government and business activity in New Zealand.

Epidemic Notices can enable modifications to other statutes in response to an

epidemic

2. Once an EN has been issued, section 15 of the EPA allows the Governor-General to make
Orders in Council on recommendation by a Minister responsible for the administration of an
enactment to modify any requirements or restrictions imposed by the enactment.

3. Section 15 allows modification of any enactment only to the extent that there is a legislative
requirement or restriction, that is impossible or impractical to comply with. Any
modifications must not go further than what is reasonably necessary in the situation.

4. It should be noted that employment agreements also set requirements on employers and
employees, but employers and employees can agree to arrangements that exceed minimum
employment standards, and frequently do. A notice under the EPA cannot modify those
agreements.

5. We are not aware of any other proposed changes through the EPA across MBIE, but there
are likely to be some proposals coming soon.

We advised you on a number of modifications to requirements which we considered

were needed in light of COVID-19

6. On 26 March 2020, we provided you with a briefing which set our advice on which
modifications are needed to requirements in the Employment Relations Act 2000 (ER Act)

s 9(2)(f)(iv) On 27 March you had a
videoconference with officials to discuss the briefing.
