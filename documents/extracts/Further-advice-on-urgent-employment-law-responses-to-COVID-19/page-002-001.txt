Purpose
This note provides further advice on urgent employment law issues relating to COVID-19 and
seeks your decisions on outstanding points.
Recommended action
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment recommends that you:
a $9(2)(h)
c Agree to not proceed with changes to the reasonable timeframe for information provision
during collective bargaining ($34), as we consider there is already flexibility in the law.
Agree / Disagree
d Agree to not proceed with changes to make it easier to initiate collective bargaining, as we
do not consider they are necessary and unions see more need for an extension to the 12-
month extension period ($53).
Agree / Disagree
e Agree to change the requirement for unions to follow ratification procedures they notified at
the beginning of collective bargaining ($51), to allow the parties to agree another ratification
process if the original process is impractical due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Agree / Disagree
