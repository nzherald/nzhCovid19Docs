Annex one: Suggested talking points - Immigration amendment
regulations

The Ad Hoc Cabinet Committee on COVID-19 Response approved policy decisions last week
which these amendment regulations enact.

. They add immigration powers to the toolkit of Health powers if COVID-19 is suspected on
board a cruise vessel.

The first changes are made to the Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission and Related Matters)
Regulations 2010. Assuming Cabinet, Executive Council and the Governor-General agrée, they
will come into effect on Wednesday

. The major change means that people on a cruise vessel will have to apply fom visa and
entry permission where the vessel has not been granted pratique — sugh as,whefe it is
suspected of having a quarantinable disease such as COVID-19 on_board.

o At the moment all cruise passengers and crew are deemed fo Hold)a visa and entry
permission when they arrive in New Zealand.

° This will give us the ability to refuse entry as appropriate~ meaning no appeal rights.

° It also means that we could grant visas to some@i@oplet particularly those who
require hospitalisation — without those visas,expirifg Automatically when the boat
leaves.

o This will not apply of course to New Zealafid citizens and resident visa holders.

° We will use it on a vessel by vessel(asis where there is a health concern, and will
continue to facilitate the entry ofmostpassengers and crew through deeming.

. The secondary change is a clarificatiog, It removes any doubt that suspending a visa
waiver — either of an individual of atlas or people — before they travel to New Zealand
automatically cancels that person’s EDA.

o This would apply*to @imtravellers as well as cruise travellers and would mean both
that they have'no legal basis to travel to New Zealand and that, if they still manage to
travel here, they @annot be deemed to hold a visa and entry permission on arrival.

Two changes are also.made ta the Immigration (Carriers’ Information Obligations) Regulations
2010. They come into effect’on 15 April 2020.

. We haveralready/enabled the MBIE Chief Executive to require carriers to request specified
information about places of concern from intending travellers and to advise INZ.

° On that basis, air and cruise carriers are currently asking passengers and crew before
bearding whether they have been in or transited mainland China or Iran in the
preceding 14 days. This is automatically repealed on 30 April 2020.

oO We are now extending that date to 30 September 2020 at this stage. The
requirement can be withdrawn at any time before that by a notification by the Chief
Executive of the Ministry.

. The other change just updates the name of the disease to coronavirus disease (COVID-
19), as the World Health Authority has changed it from 2019-nCoV in the interim.
