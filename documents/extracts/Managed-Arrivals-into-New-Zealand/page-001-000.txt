Comment

Customs continues to play a key role alongside other implementing agencies

e The key roles and responsibilities of Customs will not change under this proposal as we will
continue to process arriving passengers as usual.

e As we have done since border restrictions have been introduced, Customs will, if necessary,
ensure arriving passengers are processed by public health officials thereby enabling them to
be assessed and subsequently moved into the appropriate quarantine or managed isolation
facility.

e Customs will also continue to support other agencies to ensure the proposal can be
implemented successfully. This may mean carrying out functions not normally carried out by
Customs’ officials.

e For example, Customs staff are expected to support New Zealand Police in providing on-site
security at the hotels being used for quarantine and managed isolation.
