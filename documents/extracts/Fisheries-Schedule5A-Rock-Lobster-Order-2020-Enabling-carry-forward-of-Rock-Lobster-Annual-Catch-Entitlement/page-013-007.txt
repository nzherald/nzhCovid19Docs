Fisheries New Zealand anticipates that all monetised costs of implementing the proposed
options will be solely borne by the commercial fishing industry, including administrative
costs associated with enabling an ACE carry forward provision for rock lobster. There is
anticipated to be medium to low non-monetised costs on other affected parties, including
resource costs on Fisheries New Zealand to enable a change to ACE carry forward
provisions, and the assumption that industry will seek the resources of New Zealand Trade
and Enterprise in exploring options for alternative live export markets.
Given the short timeframe for consultation, concerns have been raised in submissions
regarding the availability of supporting information and the limited opportunity to provide
submitters appropriate time to properly consider the implications of the options proposed.
A change to the annual catch entitlement (ACE) carry forward provisions for rock lobster
are within the scope of this proposal. The proportion of uncaught ACE able to be carried
forward and the ability to provide for ACE carry forward if a stock’s total allowable
commercial catch (TACC) is reduced for that fishing year is not in the scope of this
proposal.
