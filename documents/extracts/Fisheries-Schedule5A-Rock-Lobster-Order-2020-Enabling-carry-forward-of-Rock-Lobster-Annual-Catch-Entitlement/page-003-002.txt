12. Fisheries New Zealand is satisfied that market fluctuations are a compelling argument for
enabling a proportional (up to 10%) carry forward of uncaught ACE, consistent with other
stocks. Longer term sustainability risks associated with a one-off carry forward of more
than 10% of total uncaught ACE are uncertain. However, this would set a new precedent
beyond the 10% carry forward provisions of the Act and Fisheries New Zealand have
significant concerns for sustainability and responsive management if total carry forward
was allowed.

13. On that basis and due to the exceptional circumstances and urgent need to make a
decision prior to the end of the fishing year (31 March 2020), | propose to progress with
Option B on a temporary basis for one fishing year (1 April 2020 — 31 March 2021). This
will enable some financial relief to rock lobster fishers by providing them with flexibility to
defer some catch to the next fishing year. This approach, while not supported by most of
the industry, is supported by the majority of Maori groups and some commercial interests.
It provides the most appropriate balance between providing for utilisation while ensuring
sustainability.

14. As required by the Act, carry forward provisions do not apply to any rock lobster stock
where the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) is reduced for the coming fishing
year. Rock lobster stocks will continue to be closely monitored.

15. | recommend the Committee authorise the submission of Fisheries (Schedule 5A — Rock
Lobster) Order 2020 to the Executive Council, to temporarily amend Schedule 5A of the
Fisheries Act 1996 for one fishing year (1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021), by removing all
rock lobster stocks to enable the carry forward of up to 10% of uncaught rock lobster
annual catch entitlement in response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) impacts on the Chinese
market.

Background

16. Due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and impacts on the movement of
people and transport restrictions in China, demand for rock lobster has collapsed and
Chinese buyers have cancelled orders of rock lobsters from New Zealand, Australia and
other jurisdictions.

17. This comes at an unfortunate time for fishers when large volumes of rock lobster are
usually caught and held to meet export demand for Chinese New Year celebrations (25
Jan — 8 Feb) in anticipation of the premium export prices.

18. As of 24 February 2020, Fisheries New Zealand estimated that 14% of rock lobster ACE
across all stocks is currently unfished, compared to 0.4% of unfished rock lobster at the
same time in 2019. The New Zealand Rock Lobster Industry Council (NZ RLIC) anticipates
that the unfished proportion will remain unfished by the end of the fishing year (31 March
2020), due to continuing low Chinese demand.
