Enabling relief to fishers
Option B would provide some financial relief to rock lobster fishers and the industry by
enabling up to 10% of ACE to be carried forward and would enable the value of up to
10% of uncaught ACE to be preserved, in combination with wider Government and
industry measures to mitigate impacts of low market demand.
Fisheries New Zealand considers that an opportunity to provide relief from economic
hardship would also provide flow-on benefits to coastal communities, particularly in the
regions.
Fisheries New Zealand acknowledges that individual ACE holders hold varying levels of
rock lobster ACE, and while this will not provide full relief of fishersâ€™ ACE liabilities,
Option B will provide some management flexibility and certainty for catch planning.
