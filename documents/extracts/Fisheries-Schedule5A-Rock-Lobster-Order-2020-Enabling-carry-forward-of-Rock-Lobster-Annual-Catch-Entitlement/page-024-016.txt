Section 6: Implementation and operation

6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect?
Fisheries New Zealand recommends limiting this provision to the 2020/21 fishing year only
by removing rock lobster from Schedule 5A of the Act before the end on the current fishing
year and reintroducing rock lobster into Schedule 5A for the following fishing year starting
1 April 2021.
Any changes to rock lobster ACE carry forward provisions would be subject to approval by
Cabinet, and any changes will be implemented as soon as practicable — ideally in sufficient
time to provide certainty for fishers’ catch management decisions before the end of the 31
March 2020 fishing year.
Enabling an ACE carry forward provision for up to 10% of rock lobster ACE before the end
of fishing year would require an Order in Council along a rapid timeframe, including a
waiver of the 28 day notification rule, and proceeding directly to the Cabinet Legislation
Committee without formal approval from the Cabinet Economic Development Committee.
If the Minister approves enabling an ACE carry forward provision for rock lobster for the
2020/21 fishing year only, Fisheries New Zealand will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel
Office to draft an Order in Council by mid-March, in anticipation for this to be Gazetted
shortly after. The Order in Council will be in force from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.
The Minister of Fisheries’ decision will be posted on the Fisheries New Zealand website
and social media pages, and submitters will be notified directly of the decisions.
Administrative processes would be undertaken by the service provider FishServe prior to
the start of the fishing year to enable smooth transition.
