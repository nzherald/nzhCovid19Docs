for at least a period of time. Several airlines, including Korean Air, have already done
so.

t. On 9 March 2020, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that
airlines could lose US$113 billion as a result of COVID 19. The potential losses will
have increased massively over the past week as travel restrictions have been
imposed around the world.

Border and Aviation charges

8. Airlines pay charges for a number of services provided by government agencies.
These agencies include the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Aviation Security
Service (AVSEC), the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), the New Zealand
Customs Service (Customs) and Airways Corporation of New Zealand (Airways).

9. These charges are based on passenger numbers or flight volumes. If there are
increases in passenger numbers agencies collect more money, and if passenger
numbers go down they collect reduced revenue. The COVID-19 related border
restrictions in New Zealand and overseas have caused a significant drop in
passenger numbers. This has meant that the current system of revenue based on
passenger number has seen all border and aviation agencies hit with significant and
sudden cost pressures as revenue has materially declined.

10. Border and aviation agencies are working collectively with Treasury to find a way to
address the decrease in passenger numbers and revenue, and a Cabinet paper
outlining the issues and a way forward will be developed for Cabinet consideration in
April.

11. Agencies will try to use reserves first, delay infrastructure, cut costs, re-deploy staff
where possible and operate efficiently. However, in some cases reserves will not last
long and border and aviation agencies will need equity injections to keep operating.

Relief from Border and Aviation Charges ang 9(2)(g)(i) of the OIA

The Aviation Sector has asked for relief from border and aviation charges.

13. IATA, the Board of Airline Representatives in New Zealand (BARNZ), Airlines for
Australia and New Zealand and Air New Zealand have written seeking relief from the
Government to address the significant pressures of COVID-19 on the sector.

14. In summary the request includes:

a) Deferral of future increases to fees and levies until the sector has recovered;

b) Either waiving charges for the CAA, AVSEC, Biosecurity/MPI and Customs for
a period of 6 months or reducing charges by 20% while still ensuring sufficient
funding so border and aviation staff can be retained and ready for recovery
without charging airlines;

c) Considering reductions to the International Visitor Levy;
