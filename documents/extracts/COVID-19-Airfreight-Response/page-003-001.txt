h) No implementation of blanket staff travel bans by Government agencies.

15. They have also asked for Government to ensure that as many international
connections (particularly cargo) are maintained, and that critical specialised skill-sets
needed to run the aviation system are protected during an extended downturn, and
measures are in place to support system recovery (i.e. wage subsidies and tax relief).

16. Airports have also been significantly hit with liquidity issues which will result in a
significant deferral of planned infrastructure, and are likely to seek support from
Government, particularly if the aviation impacts go on for a long period of time.

ATs: We are recommending the following short-term relief package for the sector:

a) The suspension of funding reviews across all aviation and border agencies for
the next 12 months;
b) Government financial support to airlines to pay passenger-based government
charges for 6 months (discussed in more detail below and valued at $163m
GST excl);
e) Relief from Airways fees (discussed in more detail below and valued at
$107m GST excl)
eee \\Vithheld under
2 section 9(2)(f)(iv)
- s z of the OIA
e) Working with the sector and CAA to ensure there is no regulatory
impediments to new/re-starting airlines.

18. Providing six of financial support to airlines to pay passenger-based government
charges will help airlines manage costs for those services they are able to maintain
during the current precipitous decline in demand. This may assist some airlines to
remain in New Zealand rather than exiting the market altogether.

19: It will also signal the value New Zealand places on these services and may
encourage airlines to increase services more quickly during the recovery. For
example around the 4-5 month period some services may come back on line,
particularly to and from China and Asia. This support (and the commitment to
suspending funding reviews for 12 months) may encourage airlines to choose New
Zealand early in their return to markets.

20. We consider that six months relief from charges would also be a good signal that the
government understands the impact on the sector, and would show commitment to
maintaining services and incentive to return earlier.
