COVID-19: Options for returning New Zealanders to New Zealand
Key points _ ee

e There are four options for returning New Zealanders to New Zealand: Open
commercial routes; NZ assisted charter flight; shared assisted departure flight;
NZDF operation.

e The government's messaging to New Zealanders is to use open commercial
routes where available.

e NZ charter flights and shared assisted departures should be on a cost recovery
basis.

e Emergency consular financial assistance is available for those in hardship.

e We recommend that we begin to work wi 0 explore feasibility of a
charter flight from Buenos Aires for New Zealanders stranded in Latin America.
This will include:

o assessing the number of New Zealanders in Argentina and across the
region requesting to be evacuated;

o restrictions on travel around the region that would need to be negotiated
for New Zealanders to get to the departure point;

othe option to work with the Argentine Embassy to repatriate Argentines
stranded in New Zealand;

o using the charter for freight transport; and

othe option to work with Australia on a joint assisted departure.

e We will also work in conjunction with other countries on options to put New
Zealanders on their assisted departure flights, or use our New Zealand charter
flights for reciprocal evacuations.
