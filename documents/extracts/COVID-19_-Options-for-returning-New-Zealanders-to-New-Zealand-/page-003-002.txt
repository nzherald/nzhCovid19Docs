COVID-19: Options for returning New Zealanders to New Zealand

Recommendations

It is recommended that you:

1 Agree that the government's messaging to New Zealanders is to Yes/No
use commercial routes where available.

2 Note that we are working with other countries on options for shared Yes/No
assisted departures.

3 Note that we are working through other charter flight options where Yes/No
there are no available flight routes back to New Zealand.

4 Agree that New Zealand charter flights and assisted departure Yes/No
flights shared with partner countries should be on a cost recovery
basis and only where no commercial options are available.

5 Agree we explore with the feasibility of a Buenos Yes/No
Aires charter flight as the first evacuation flight.

6 Note NZDF aircraft are only a back-up option for the Pacific Islands Yes/No
and Australia.
