COVID-19: Options for returning New Zealanders to New Zealand

Report

1. There are four options for returning New Zealanders to New Zealand: Open
commercial routes; NZ assisted charter flight; shared assisted departure flight;
NZDF operation.

2. Air New Zealand has committed to keeping a number of commercial flight routes
open under the deal with the government. There are also a number of other
commercial airlines operating flight to global hubs, including Cathay Pacific,
Singapore Airways, Qatar, Emirates, Latam and Qantas.

3. Air New Zealand committed flight routes are:

Long haul Auckland — North America (LAX)

| Aucktand Hong Kong

PS Auckland — Singapore

Auckland ~ Sydney

Po Auckland — Melbourne

— Auckland — Brisbane

Auckland — Niue

Po Auckland — Rarotonga

| Auektand = Nat

| Aucktand ~ Tonga

J Auckland — Apia

4. We are receiving approaches from a number of countries signalling that they may
be putting together assisted departure plans for their nationals stranded in
New Zealand. We will work in conjunction with other countries on options to put
New Zealanders on these flights, or use our New Zealand charter flights in a
reciprocal evacuation on a cost recovery basis.

5. We have received an approach from Australia to work together on assisted
departures as they begin to consider options. Should Australia be able to assist
with evacuating New Zealanders to an Australian drop point, we will consider
charter options from Australia to New Zealand, as we did with the Diamond
Princess.

6. New Zealand charter flights and shared assisted departures should be on a cost
recovery basis. Consular emergency funding is available to New Zealanders in
hardship situations. Government messaging should continue to advise New
Zealanders attempting to return home to use commercial routes where available.
