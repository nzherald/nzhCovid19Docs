New Zealand — Chile Transit Arrangement

Report

4.

2. In your conversation with the Chilean Foreign Minister on 1 April, you agreed that
New Zealand and Chile would enter into a bilateral arrangement to allow transit as
part of efforts to repatriate respective nationals. The basis for this was agreement
was the Cabinet decision on 25 March 2020 that exemptions to New Zealand’s
transit restrictions would be permitted as part of repatriation where there was a
Government to Government agreement in place. [CAB-20-MIN-0130]. You and the
Minister of Immigration subsequently endorsed this approach via submission on 3
April 2020.

3. A bilateral arrangement was reached with Chile on 5 April through an exchange of
Third Person Notes between the New Zealand Embassy in Santiago and the
Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Officials were operating with a matter of
urgency given the imminent transit of New Zealanders through Santiago (the only
remaining transit point for New Zealand in Latin America). Because of this
urgency, this arrangement was entered into ahead of the Cabinet discussion on 6
April.

4. The provisions in the Chile / New Zealand arrangement are high-level. In the case
of Chilean transits, it provides for Chileans, in international transit to enter
New Zealand, provided they do not leave the international area of the airport. This
language is mirrored for New Zealanders and residents seeking to transit Chile/s6(a)

5. In light of the Cabinet_agreement, officials have sought to revise the transit
arrangement with Chile. 86(a), s6(b) s6(b)

6. It is critical that this matter is resolved as a matter of urgency.'s6(a)

This would
almost certainly disrupt the repatriation of New Zealanders currently stranded in
Peru. Arrangements for the charter flight are well-advanced. The flight will depart
Lima on 13/14 April and will transit Santiago en route to New Zealand.
