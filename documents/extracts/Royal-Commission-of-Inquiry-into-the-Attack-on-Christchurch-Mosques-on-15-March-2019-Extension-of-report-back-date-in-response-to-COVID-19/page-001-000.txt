Title: Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Attack on Christchurch
Mosques on 15 March 2019: Extension of report-back date in
response to COVID-19
Date: 7 April 2020
EES
The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Attack on Christchurch Mosques on 15 March 2019 (the
Royal Commission) is due to report back to the Governor-General on 30 April 2020. The Royal
Commission has advised that it will be unable to meet this reporting date. The current Level 4
COVID-19 response has also created additional uncertainty regarding when the Royal Commission
will be able to provide its report.
The attached draft Cabinet paper seeks an amendment to the Royal Commission’s terms of
reference to amend the reporting date from 30 April 2020 until 31 July 2020, or such earlier or later
date as may be determined by the Minister of Internal Affairs, in consultation with the Attorney-
General and the Chair of the Royal Commission. This would provide additional time for the Royal
Commission to complete its report and provide you with the flexibility to change the reporting date
if required should the COVID-19 pandemic response continue to adversely affect the Royal
Commission’s ability to report.
