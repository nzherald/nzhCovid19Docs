Background
Expanding the scope of the temporary border control measures
4: On 1 February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealand’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.
2. Due to the on-going risks in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak, on 14 February 2020
Ministers with Power to Act agreed to extend the temporary border measures for anyone who
has been present in or transited through mainland China within the last 14 days until 24
February 2020.
3. On 21 February 2020, Ministers with Power to Act, agreed to extend the temporary border
measures to those who were on board the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship that try to enter
New Zealand within 14 days of disembarking from ship.
4. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control
measures:
a. New Zealand citizens
b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders
c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder
d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand
e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrival’ by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers and
marine and aircraft crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific
expedition under the auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.
Amendment to Border Entry instructions
Proposed new immigration instructions
5. The proposed immigration instructions contained in Appendix 1 state that entry permission
must be refused to any person who attempts to travel to New Zealand within 14 days of
disembarking the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship (IMO: 9228198, flagged to the United
Kingdom), operated by Princess Cruises.
6. The proposed immigration instructions are applicable until 11:59 pm 24 February 2020
unless amended or revoked earlier.
Te Further immigration instructions will be provided for certification if this response needs to be
extended beyond 24 February 2020.
‘ Although deemed to hold entry permission it is possible to suspend their visa waiver status for Cruise ship
passengers and marine and aircraft crew at any point between embarkation onto the craft and arrival in New
Zealand. It may also be possible to revoke their entry permission and cancel their visa on arrival if they arrive
in an immigration control area.
