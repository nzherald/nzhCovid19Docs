Local Government briefing

Hon Nanaia Mahuta

Minister of Local Government

Title: Approval to draft an Order in Council under the Epidemic

Preparedness Act 2006 to make an essential modification to the
Local Government Act 2002

Date: 30 March 2020
Key issues
This briefing outlines that the Chief Executive of the Department of Internal Affairs recommends an
essential modification is made to the Local Government Act 2002 (LGAO2) using the immediate
modification order mechanism under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 (EPA).
On 20 and 24 March 2020 we provided you with advice on the local government sector’s concerns
and the potential use of the EPA to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on local authorities. Two of
these concerns have been subsequently addressed through the COVID-19 Response (Urgent
Management Measures) Legislation Act 2020 (the Act). S99(Hi))
We are therefore recommending only one modification order at this time. The order would modify
the requirement for newly elected members to sign a written declaration and have this witnessed
by another member or the chief executive of the local authority before they can act as members.
This is a now a problem for council meetings conducted solely by audio or audio-visual link, as was
enabled by the Act.
