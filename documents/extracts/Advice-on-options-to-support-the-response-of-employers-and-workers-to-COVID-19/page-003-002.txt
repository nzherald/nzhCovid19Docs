Key messages

* There are two key objectives for consideration of leave and pay for leave for time away
from work in the COVID-19 context:

o Workers stay at home when required (whether for self-isolation or because they
are sick or caring for dependents who are self-isolating or sick). This is for public
health reasons, worker wellbeing, and workplace health and safety.

o Workers and firms should not be disproportionately penalised financially by
complying with public health measures which are in place for the public good.

e Existing health and safety settings support the public health response to COVID-19, by
allowing employers to require workers not to come to work if they are sick or diagnosed
with COVID-19, or if they have been advised to self-isolate.

* Some employees will be willing and able to work from home, and this approach will allow
for both public health and income security objectives to be met for some workers.

* However, many workers will not be able to work from home, and will not have sufficient
sick leave or annual holiday leave accumulated to fund the length of absence that is
likely to be required if an employee is directly or indirectly impacted by COVID-19.

e Employers can, at their discretion, offer various forms of ‘special paid leave’ to cover
lengthier absences from work that are beyond the employee's control, but many will
struggle to afford this and some may not choose to do so.

¢ Ministers may also consider it is undesirable for employees to use their sick or annual
leave to address this gap. This is the view of the Council of Trade Unions. MBIE
considers that workers should not bear all of the costs of complying with this public
health directive, but this is currently likely for some workers, particularly vulnerable and
low paid workers.

e To ensure the right outcomes, you may wish to consider:

o For state sector employees: Set Government expectations for state sector
employers to provide special paid leave to employees who are forced to take an
extended period away from work (and not working) because of COVID-19.

o Inthe wider labour market: provide financial assistance for firms and/or workers
to allow workers to be paid for some/all of the duration of a COVID-19-related
absence, without unduly drawing down on other leave balances.

* Ifyou wish to progress any of these options, a range of design choices need to be
considered, e.g. how targeted or broad any scheme should be, and the appropriate
delivery mechanism for any financial assistance for firms or workers. You will want to
ensure any scheme is defined for COVID-19 and not for wider work disruption from other
causes (droughts etc), is time limited, does not incur significant deadweight cost
(replacing employer efforts), and mitigates any moral hazard risks.

¢ Other options are available to address marginal issues relating to our statutory leave
settings, but in general these options are complex, would require legislative change, and
would not address the fundamental financial gap that is likely to prevent workers from
being paid through COVID-19 disruptions. Changes to legislative entitlements would be
slow and the key issue is pay for such leave. You are not likely to legislate for special
paid leave fully funded by employers in these circumstances.
