. Eligibility to paid sick leave only kicks in after 6 months working for a
particular employer (eligibility and entitlement issue). Employees who have
recently changed jobs will likely have no sick leave entitlement, and employees
in “vulnerable” categories (e.g. casual employees) are unlikely to have an
entitlement. This issue has been identified by the Holidays Act Taskforce for
improvement.

. Sick leave is restrictively defined in the Holidays Act (entitlement issue). Its
use is confined to situations where the employee (or their dependant) is sick or
injured. The Act does not clearly allow sick leave to be used in situations where
an employee is self-isolating, but not actually sick. (This limitation does not,
however, apply to any ‘sick leave’ provided over and above the minimum
entitlement, which is purely a matter of contractual agreement between the
parties.)

. There may be equity considerations for employees who use their annual
holiday entitlements in order to be paid through a time when they were unable to
work through circumstances beyond their control, versus those who are paid out
of discretionary benefits (‘special leave’) or contingent benefits (i.e. benefits that
are only available in some circumstances, such as sick leave).

12. There are options that may address, or partially address, these issues. These include:
. Issue non-legislative guidance that sick leave should be used in circumstances

that are not strictly captured by Act (e.g. self-isolation).

. Amend the Holidays Act to extend the sick leave entitlement to more than 5 days
(e.g. to 10 days as favoured by union movement). This could be targeted.

e Amend the Holidays Act to allow sick leave to be used in circumstances where
the employee (or dependant) is isolating or quarantined per public health
guidance.

. Amend the Holidays Act to create an additional, standalone category of leave
entitlement for circumstances where employee (or dependant) is isolating or
quarantined per public health guidance

13. However, these options involve legislative change, could be slow to implement, and
would only address the funding issue if you legislated for employers to pay the full
costs, which appears inappropriate in the current circumstances given your objectives.

14. We can provide further advice on these options if you wish, but we do not recommend
pursuing these options as a priority at this stage. Direct financial assistance is likely to
be the fastest, simplest, and most effective measure to deal with the presenting
concerns. It can also be scaled up or down very rapidly as the situation develops.

Next steps

15. We suggest that you discuss with your Cabinet colleagues whether further work on the
financial assistance options presented should be progressed.

16. Note that MBIE has not yet discussed this paper with officials from other agencies, but
further work would require input from The Treasury, SSC, and the Ministry of Social
Development at a minimum.
