Context

1. Our advice on 4 March gave an overview of how workers affected by COVID-19 are
covered by employment and health and safety law, including paid leave entitlements.
In the current context of a relatively confined impact of COVID-19 in New Zealand, our
workplace laws generally provide for:

. Health and safety risk assessments by businesses and workers that are
grounded in legal duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act.

. A range of options for employers and employees to consider, for categorising
and remunerating time away from work.

2. However, in the context where there is a real possibility of many staff being required to
self-isolate for at least 14 days, it is inevitable that many staff will exhaust all their
available leave balances (whether sick leave or annual leave). This increases the
likelihood of employees having a financial incentive to return to work, even if this
contravenes public health directives. If this was to happen at a large scale, it would
taise the possibility of labour market settings undermining (or at least not supporting)
the public health objectives that underpin the government’s COVID-19 response.

3. While employers can, at their discretion, offer various forms of special paid leave to
cover lengthier absences from work that are beyond the employee’s control, many will
struggle to afford this. The key gap in this scenario is financial, rather than any
regulatory barrier.

4. We therefore consider that developing financial support options to assist businesses to
do right by their employees, through a period of significant disruption, should be the
first priority for further work. There are additional options to address possible gaps in
our leave settings (e.g. marginal changes to our sick leave settings), but these are
complex and involve broader risks and legislative change. We do not recommend
pursuing these options as a priority at this stage.

Developing options to assist businesses to pay workers through

COVID-19-related absences

5. Work to develop options for an economic support package for businesses severely
affected by COVID-19 is already underway. This will include looking at a variety of
economic support levers, including wage subsidies and other forms of business
support. We consider that worker-focused options should be developed in conjunction
with this work, to ensure workers continue to get paid when sick, self-isolating, or
caring for dependants who fall into these categories.

6. | SSC’s advice to the public service is that special paid leave should be used where
people are not sick or have no further sick leave available. This could be considered
best practice.

7. Broadly, we think the priority for further policy development should be on options that
support firms to follow best practice for paying workers who are forced to be absent
from work due to COVID-19. The two main (complementary) options are to:

° set Government expectations that state sector employers absorb the cost of
providing special paid leave to employees; and/or
