. provide a limited subsidy for firms or ‘special COVID-19 paid leave’ financial
assistance for targeted groups of workers in the private sector.’

8. With respect to any financial assistance to the private sector, there will be a number of
design choices to work through to ensure that workers and their employers are
appropriately supported and to avoid unnecessary deadweight cost or moral hazard
issues, including:

. How broad or targeted any subsidy scheme should be. For example, you could
target this by firm circumstances, firm size, income level, or type of worker.

. Payment mechanism (this would need to be an already-established mechanism,
eg MSD, ACC or IR, to expedite delivery of support payments).

. The quantum of financial support that should be provided to workers who are
sick or self-isolating or unable to work because of workplace closures, and
whether this should be differentiated according to the worker's income.

° Choices around how the support should be delivered, e.g. directly to workers or
through their employers.

. How workers that are not employees can be included in any support package
(particularly if the support is in any way tied to entitlements that pertain only to
employees).

. Contribution expectations for employers.

. Conditions that should attach to receipt of any worker support package (if this is
provided to businesses), while not discouraging take up.

9. | We recommend that you direct officials to complete work on the design of possible
worker support options, in conjunction with the wider economic support/stimulus work
that is currently underway.

Other potential issues relating to leave and leave pay settings

10. In general, unless an employer elects to pay over and above the minimum legal
requirements, payment for time spent away from work and not working will depend on
the employee both:

. Being eligible for a category of leave that can lawfully be applied to the absence
in question

. Having a current entitlement to the type of leave in question (ie “time in the
bank”, or an ability to take leave in advance). This becomes relevant only if, in
the first instance, eligibility is not an issue.

11. Potential issues we have identified with our leave settings are:

. The minimum entitlement to sick leave is only five days per year
(entitlement issue). Where sick leave is available, the length of absences
required by COVID-19 is likely to be such that the entitlement is exhausted. This
is problematic without a financial assistance scheme.

‘ Ifyou are concemed about the funded sector’, ie those who are not employees of the state, options for the private sector

would address these workers.
