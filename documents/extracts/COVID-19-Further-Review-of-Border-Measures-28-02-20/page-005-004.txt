Background / context

1. Effective border management continues to be the best way to protect New Zealanders
from the health effects of a potential outbreak of COVID-19. Officials continue to
recommend taking a precautionary approach, as epidemiology of the outbreak and
scientific knowledge develop.

2. You recently considered advice on border measure changes to categorise areas of
concern. You agreed that current temporary border restrictions apply to cover people
who have been in, or transited areas in Category One (including mainland China and
lran) in the 14 days prior to boarding.

3. Officials advised that you would receive further recommendations for the response to
areas in Category Two. These recommendations are set out in this paper.

Border measures

4. The areas in Category One should be subject to both hard and soft border measures.
This recognises the high risk of exposure to the virus in these areas, and therefore the
higher risk of importation to New Zealand associated with travel related to those areas.
People that have been in Category One areas and arrive in New Zealand are expected
to undertake a 14 day isolation period per Ministry of Health guidance.

5. Also in Category One is the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. On 24 February 2020,
Ministers with Power to Act agreed that travellers who were on board the Diamond
Princess will be refused entry into New Zealand within a 14-day period of
disembarking. This excludes those exempted under current border measures.

6. Note that Category Two areas can be subject to soft border measures which can
include screening, informing and triaging passengers that arrive in New Zealand for
symptoms or indicators of COVID-19. Options on these measures are provided further
below.

7. Officials have reviewed the Technical Advisory Group recommendations provided on 27
February 2020 and have the considered the following for Category Two (current as at
28 February 2020):
