globally and trade of goods, and confidence effects (for example, reduced consumer
demand for international travel, and reduced business and investor confidence
globally).

27. An onshore pandemic or widespread outbreak would mean economic disruption that is
potentially more widespread and longlasting than any short-run effects of border
closures.

28. Even if we work out a way to reduce the public health input to checks and information
provision at airports, adding further places of concern means that more people (New
Zealanders returning from those places of concern) are being monitored and supported
in self-isolation. If in fact these people are low risk, this means that we are directing our
scarce public health resources and attention away from higher risk areas - our
preparedness and our response/containment activities.

29. So while there would be some negative effects on tourism and international education
in particular from further border closures (as these are most highly exposed to
restrictions on people movements), the total economic impacts from border closures at
any of the countries currently in Category Two are therefore expected to be net positive
if the closure is considered effective and necessary from a public health perspective.

30. Further whole-of-government advice is being prepared for Cabinet on 9 March on
economic and health scenarios that might play out from here and the appropriate
government responses including in respect of when overall changes to border
management might be advisable.

Foreign affairs considerations

31. While the decision is necessarily about the threat to public health, there are foreign
affairs considerations. Time will be required to notify partner governments if any
changes are proposed.
