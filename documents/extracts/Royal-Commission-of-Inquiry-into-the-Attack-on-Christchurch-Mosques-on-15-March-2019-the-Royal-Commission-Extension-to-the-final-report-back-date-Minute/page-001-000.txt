Report Back

Portfolio Internal Affairs

On 15 April 2020, the Cabinet Business Committee, in accordance with the Power to Act authorised

by Cabinet [CAB-20-MIN-0145]:

ip noted that on 10 November 2019, Cabinet approved additional funding of $3.000 million
and a revised final report back date of 30 April 2020 [CAB-19-MIN-0584];

2 noted that the Royal Commission has advised that it will be unable to deliver its report by
30 April 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional uncertainty regarding
when the Royal Commission will be able to deliver its final report;

3 noted that there are a number of considerations when deciding on an extension date,
including:

3.1 the need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic context;

3.2 the time between the attack and the Inquiry report;

3.3. the timeframes for additional, system-wide improvements necessary following the
attack; and,

3.4 the cost of an extension;

4 noted that on balance amending the terms of reference to set a report date of 31 July 2020
and to allow the Minister of Internal Affairs to vary that date for the final report is the
preferred option;

5 agreed to amend the terms of reference for the Royal Commission so that the reporting date
will be 31 July 2020, or such earlier or later date as may be determined by the Minister of
Intermal Affairs, in consultation with the Attorney-General, to be feasible and appropriate,
after consultation with the Chair of the Royal Commission;

6 noted that additional funding required by the Royal Commission will be met from
Departmental of Internal Affairs (DIA) baselines until the end of May 2020;
