Background
Temporary border control measures
1. On 1 February 2020, Cabinet authorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on
New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 outbreak and propose enhanced border measures
[CAB-20-MIN-0015]. These included introducing temporary border control measures
restricting the ability of people who have been in or transited through mainland China from
entering New Zealand.
2y Ministers with Power to Act agreed to extend the temporary border measures to those who
try to enter New Zealand within 14 days of disembarking from the Diamond Princess cruise
ship.
3. On 24 February 2020, Cabinet agreed to extend the temporary border measures until 3
March 2020 [CAB-20-MIN-0053].
4. On 27 February 2020 Ministers with Power to Act agreed to expand the temporary border
measures to include Iran.
5. The following people will continue to be excluded from the temporary border control
measures:
a. New Zealand citizens
b. New Zealand resident and permanent resident visa holders
c. The partner, dependent children or legal guardian travelling with a New Zealand
citizen, resident or permanent resident visa holder
d. Australian citizens and permanent resident visa holders whose primary place of
residence is New Zealand
e. People deemed to have entry permission on arrivalâ€™ by regulation 25 of the
Immigration (Visa, Entry Permission, and Related Matters) Regulations 2010 (the
Regulations). This includes a number of groups such as cruise ship passengers
(who travel to New Zealand as part of a scheduled cruise) and marine and aircraft
crew, members of a visiting force, and members of a scientific expedition under the
auspices of a Contracting Party to the Antarctic Treaty.
Amendment to Border Entry instructions
Proposed new immigration instructions
6. The following proposed changes to immigration instructions expand the temporary border
measures to refuse entry permission to any person who has been present in or transited
through Iran within 14 days prior to boarding a commercial craft bound for New Zealand. This
will be effective from 06:00pm 28 February 2020 until 11:59 pm 3 March 2020 unless
amended or revoked earlier.
7. Further immigration instructions will be provided for certification if this response needs to be
extended beyond 3 March 2020.
* Although deemed to hold entry permission it is possible to suspend their visa waiver status for Cruise ship
Passengers and marine and aircraft crew at any point between embarkation onto the craft and arrival in New
Zealand. It may also be possible to revoke their entry permission and cancel their visa on arrival if they arrive
in an immigration control area.
