Explanatory note

This note is not part of the notice, but is intended to indicate its general effect.

By this notice, the Prime Minister declares that she is satisfied that the effects of the

outbreak of COVID-19 are likely to disrupt or continue to disrupt essential govern-

mental and business activity in New Zealand significantly.

This notice comes into force on 25 March 2020. Under section 5(3) of the Epidemic

Preparedness Act 2006, the notice expires on the day that is 3 months after its com-

mencement, unless—

. an earlier expiry date is notified; or

‘ the notice is renewed under section 7 of that Act.

The notice is one way in which the following powers under the Health Act 1956 are

activated (they can also be activated by the Minister of Health authorising their use or

by a state of emergency being declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Manage-

ment Act 2002):

. the special powers of medical officers of health under section 70 of the Health
Act 1956:

. the requisition powers of medical officers of health under section 71 of that
Act.

The notice also activates section 24 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, which will

enable certain Judges and Associate Judges to, in particular cases, modify rules of

court as they think necessary in the interests of justice to take account of the effects of

COVID-19.

The notice is a prerequisite for—

. the making of notices under section 74C of the Health Act 1956 (these notices
can require that medicines under the control of the Crown or a Crown entity are
administered, dispensed, prescribed, or supplied in accordance with priorities
determined by the Director-General of Health):

. the making of epidemic management notices under section 8 of the Epidemic
Preparedness Act 2006, which can—

. activate dormant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011, the
Immigration Act 2009, the Parole Act 2002, the Sentencing Act 2002, and
the Social Security Act 2018 that are intended to deal with an out- break of
disease; and

. activate prospective modification orders under section 11 and 12 of that
Act (these orders may modify requirements or restrictions in legislation,
either for the purpose of enabling the effective management of an out-
break or dealing with requirements or restrictions that are or may well be
impossible or impracticable to comply with):
