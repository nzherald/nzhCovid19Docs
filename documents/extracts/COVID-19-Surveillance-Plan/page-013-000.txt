7 Non traditional forms of surveillance

Anumber of additional information systems have been set up by different agencies that may have
some utility for surveillance. However there is risk in drawing upon information that is unvalidated
or potentially misleading. These options will be assessed systematically by the Ministry of Health.
They include:

monitoring compliance with movement restrictions. IQ TAIOO)

These and other emerging novel approaches will be assessed as they arise by the Ministry of Health,
in consultation with the Ministryâ€™s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Group.
