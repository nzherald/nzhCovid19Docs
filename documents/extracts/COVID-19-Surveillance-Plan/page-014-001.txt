8 Implementation
8.1 Supporting operational public health measures
COVID-19 has been designated as a notifiable disease, meaning that Aotearoa/New Zealandâ€™s
standard notifiable disease system applies. Public Health Units have access via EpiSurv to contact
and cluster outbreak data for their management of cases. While PHUs are under considerable
pressure, surveillance information to support the public health response is not a limiting factor in
the management of cases and clusters.
8.2 Supporting policy decisions on social distancing measures
Decisions on de-escalation from COVID-19 Alert Level 4 on a regional or national basis will be
supported by our core notifiable disease system, in conjunction with the enhanced community
surveillance of testing from CBAC and other community sources. This system has the capability to
report cases and rates of cases in geographic and demographic detail.
