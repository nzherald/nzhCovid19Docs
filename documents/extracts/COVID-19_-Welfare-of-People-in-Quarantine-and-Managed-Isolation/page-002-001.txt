Noting paper
To: COVID-19 Ministerial Group
| Date 2/04/2020 From National Crisis Management Centre |
Purpose
1. This paper updates you on issues related to the welfare of people who are either in quarantine
(for those who arrive in the country with symptoms of COVID-19 illness), or “managed isolation”
(those without symptoms but who are compelled to self-isolate).
2. This paper does not cover support for the broader population who are now in “self-isolation”
as required by Alert Level 4 of the COVID-19 response.
Recommendations
3. We recommend you
note officials are working to ensure that supporting elements, such as domestic repatriation to
at-home self-isolation, planning for future international scheduled and repatriation flights, and
management of the quarantine and isolation facilities and associated welfare support, is well
coordinated;
note upon arrival in New Zealand, people who are symptomatic and showing signs of illness
are tested, treated as necessary, and placed in quarantine for 14 days. Passengers not
displaying symptoms may also be required to undergo a 14-day period of managed self-
isolation;
note while most are coping, the key concerns of people in isolation are related to uncertainty
about the period after their quarantine ends, and for some job security; and
note to help address these concerns there are a range of welfare support measures in place
including financial assistance packages, accommodation, access to essential goods and
services, psychosocial support, and welfare checks after the return home.
