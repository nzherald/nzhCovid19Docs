Domestic air travel is very limited.
New Zealanders entering at our borders undergo strict measures to isolate or quarantine.
From midnight tonight, we bunker down for four weeks.
| am fully aware that we have moved with huge speed. No other country in the world has
moved to these measures with no death and so few infections.
Shutting down your economy takes planning, that is what we did. We signalled it, asked
people to prepare, and then moved decisively.
These moves will be enforced.
And we will be the enforcer.
Failure of anyone to play their part in coming days will put the lives of others at risk, and
there will be no tolerance for that. We will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers if
needed.
Through the early and hard measures we've taken at the border, the signing of epidemic
notices, under the Public Health Act and now, being in a state of national emergency, we
have all of the legislative means possible, all the enforcement powers, all the tools we
need, at our disposal to combat the spread of Covid-19.
Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, todayâ€™s state of national
emergency declaration means the Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management
may control the exercise and performance of functions, duties, and powers of Civil
Defence Emergency Management Groups and Group Controllers across the country.
While in force, it will allow national and local controllers to provide for the

e conservation and supply of food, fuel and other essential supplies

e regulate land, water and air traffic

e to close roads and public places

e to evacuate any premises, including any public place,

e And if necessary to exclude people or vehicles from any premises or place.
This declaration helps us limit our exposure, and the exposure of the most vulnerable
members of our community, to Covid-19. In short, it will help save lives.
