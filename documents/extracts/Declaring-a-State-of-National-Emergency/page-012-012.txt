4IN-CONFIDENCE-
The first was on February the 23rd 2011.
It followed the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch. It followed the death of many
New Zealanders, the total destruction of much infrastructure and the crippling of essential
services.
It was declared to allow the greatest possible coordination of local, national, and
international resources to work on rescue and recovery.
Today we put in place our country’s second state of national emergency as we fight a
global pandemic, as we fight to save New Zealanders’ lives. To prevent the very worst
that we've seen in other countries around the world from happening here. To protect our
essential health services. To cushion the economic impacts of Covid-19.
Astate of national emergency to preserve our way of life.
At 11.59pm tonight, we move to the highest Alert Level of 4, and we go into lockdown.
The trigger: early evidence of community transmission of Covid-19 in New Zealand. But
unlike so many other gravely inundated countries, we have a window of opportunity to
break the chain of transmission of a silent killer.
We move to lockdown ahead of any potential widespread community transmission,
ahead of any potential over-run of our hospitals, and ahead of any deaths on New
Zealand soil.
This means we will go about life very differently to help slow down the spread of covid-19.
We all have a role to play.
Only those in essential services work. All others stay home and stop interactions with
those outside the home.
Non-essential business premises close.
Events and gatherings are cancelled.
Schools close.
Public transport is reserved for those undertaking essential services and transport of
freight.
