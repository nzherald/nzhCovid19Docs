IN CONFIBDENCE-

The restrictions in place on New Zealanders’ movements are the most significant in our
modern history. | do not underestimate the gravity of what is being asked of you. But we
have a limited window of opportunity and we must use every weapon we have.
We will enforce in the national interest.
New Zealanders want to see that these measures are being complied with but in a way
that we’re used to seeing as New Zealanders.
As Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, the Police and the Military will be working
together and there is assistance at the ready as required.
Of course, New Zealanders rally.
The full extent of these measures | don’t expect will be used but as with everything we
have done in response to covid-19 — we plan, we prepare, we have in place everything
we need to get through.
| repeat now:

- If we don’t unite we will be in lockdown for longer

- Every person needs to play their part

- Staying home and limiting contact will save lives

- We will be enforcing all measures

- Itis as simple as that
We are pulling out all the stops to protect the health of New Zealanders and the health of
our economy.
At this time, | say to everyone, go home, protect our health service, save lives.
And while we enforce, the job of New Zealanders is to support others.
For four weeks our interactions are limited. The joy of physically visiting other family,
children, grandchildren, friends, neighbours is on hold.
But it is this joy we endeavour to preserve, to ensure it remains there for you to
experience once again, and again, and again, once we get through Covid-19.
