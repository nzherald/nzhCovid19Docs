Mr Speaker
I wish to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 347 in relation to the
recent declaration of a state of national emergency [by my colleague Hon Peeni
Henare, Minister of Civil Defence].
Having considered the advice of the Director of Civil Defence Emergency
Management, [and in consultation with the Prime Minister] | [the Minister of Civil
Defence] declared a State of National Emergency for the whole of New Zealand
under section 66 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002
on [date declaration issues]
at [time declaration issued].
This was to manage the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic within New Zealand.
| [The Minister of Civil Defence] took this step because of the unprecedented nature of
this global pandemic, and because | [he] considered the response required to combat
Covid-19 is of such a degree that it will be beyond the capacity of local Civil
Defence Emergency Management Groups to respond to on their own. This
pandemic also requires a significant and coordinated response by and across
central and local government.
This is the second time in New Zealand’s history that a state of national emergency has
been declared.
