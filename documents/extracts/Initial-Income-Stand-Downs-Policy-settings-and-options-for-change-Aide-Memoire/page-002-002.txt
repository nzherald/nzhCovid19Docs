the significant equity, precedent-setting and
administrative issues it would present.

e Iam seeking a decision on what the Committee’s
preferred option is. Pending this decision, I will direct my
officials to provide further advice on the operational,
legislative and financial implications of the chosen
option.

Background This Cabinet paper was written in response to the Cabinet
meeting on 2 March 2020, where you were invited to ‘provide
further advice to Ministers on 4 March 2020 on whether the
stand-down period could be removed for workers who lose
employment as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19’
[CAB-20-MIN-0068 refers].

s 9(2)(f)(iv)
As the Cabinet paper notes, with the temporary removal of
stand-downs option, the change can be made by amending the
Social Security Regulations 2018 only. 92")
If questions are raised as to whether implementation
timeframes for removing stand-downs can be shortened, you
may wish to note that MSD is currently exploring an alternative
implementation option that would involve an interim method for
removing stand-downs. This interim measure can shorten the
implementation timeframes for both the permanent and
temporary removal of stand-downs option from three months to
about four weeks. MSD are continuing to work through the risks
of this interim measure.

Next steps Pending a decision on an option from CVD, further work will be
done to refine the operational, legislative and financial
implications of the chosen option. This work includes, but is not
limited to:

e drafting financial recommendations and identifying a
funding source (we will work with Treasury on this)

e drafting recommendations for the necessary legislative
amendments

¢ confirming the implementation date of the chosen option
