Further support options

Labour market

30. Labour market initiatives that could be readily implemented, subject to policy decisions, centre
around easing visa conditions:

a. Should labour market constraints become apparent, provide a pathway for further visas
for existing staff (for another 6 months), if the employer faces recruitment difficulties
because of the travel restrictions.

b. Allowing partners of workers that are in New Zealand to vary the conditions of their visa
to enable them to work, if the main earner (and work visa holder) is offshore afd Unable
to get onshore

Ministry of Social Development

31. The Ministry of Social Development's (MSD) financial assistance is availabléto individuals
and families. This includes ongoing assistance such as Jobseeker Support forthose who no
longer have an income. Other ongoing assistance includes payments stich as
Accommodation Supplement and Working for Families tax credits that aré available alongside
main benefits. Further, hardship assistance such as Special\Needs Grants and Temporary
Additional Support are available to help with essential and.immediate needs such as food and
rent.

32. The Ministry of Social Development can deploygome income support that does not involve a
stand-down, and eligible people can still access hardship assistance such as Special Needs
Grants during a benefit stand-down period if needed

Additional options that could be developed

33. Should the economic impact of the(CQVID-19 worsen (either by deepening impacts on
particular sectors, or broadening‘acrossAhe economy), there are a range of interventions
available to the government. At,this stage, given the scale of the current impact, we are not
recommending immediate,implementation.

Business engagement

34. MBIE will investigate Whether the current sector-by-sector engagement is the best model, or if
a more joined up approach is required. This would entail working with chambers of commerce,
councils, and"ecohomic development agencies in affected regions to ensure information on
support is feadily available and support monitoring activity.

Labourmarkef

35. There are options across the immigration and domestic labour market systems:

a. ~ Allow those on visitor visas to vary the conditions of their visas and work (similar to a
labour shortage declaration under current settings);

b. Crown funding fees for people on various visas to reduce the overall financial burden on
employers, and assist in recruitment efforts;
