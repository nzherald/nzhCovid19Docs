Forestry

13. New Zealand forest exports to China are worth $3.5 billion and nearly 80% of New Zealand’s
logs are exported there. Some forest exporters are reporting to MPI that from next week key
Chinese ports will reach storage capacity and be unable to unload logs. This is because China
is prioritising movement of tier one products (e.g. essential food and medical supplies), and
because internal restrictions to manage the spread of COVID-19 mean wood processing and
construction industries are remaining in shut-down. Should this eventuate it will likely take
many weeks for current log volumes at ports to clear, and there may be flow-on impacts in
terms of shipping route disruption.

14. While many New Zealand forestry companies are continuing to operate, this may chafige.with
uncertainty about ongoing disruptions in market. Larger corporate foresters will be better
placed to explore alternative markets for their wood products, but smaller foresOwhers*may
choose to cease harvesting. The most immediate impacts are for harvesting contractors and
transport operators, with some crews either stopping operations or working/at reduéed
capacity. The Gisborne region has been particularly affected to date. Trust*Pairawhiti has
identified 37 businesses potentially affected in the region, predominantly forestry and
representing 481 workers.

15. Arapid slowdown in harvesting may also reduce volumes available for domestic processors.
This occurs as harvesting usually produces wood for both domestiéand international markets
at the same time (different parts of a log are suitable for differenttuses). There are
approximately 30,000 workers within the forest segt6t 7,000 of which work in forest
harvesting and related support areas. Numbers@f jobs impacted by the COVID-19 disruption
will depend on the length and severity of the disruption.

International Education

16. The main affected segment of educationyexports is the market for onshore delivery to Chinese
nationals. In 2019, this was worth $4=%5bhyin broader economic contribution (BEC) to New
Zealand?, with $500m of this being fee*revenue.

17. From arrival data and reperted,enrolments we believe that roughly 59% of Chinese students
are in-country, meaningythattthere%s an immediate fee revenue effect of at least $75m
(although likely to increase,withytime), concentrated in the university sector.

18. The in-year revenue and eGonomic shock is significant, but can be managed. The longer-term
implications are 6re Significant, due to a mix of pipeline effects (the future effect of reduced
enrolments in multtyéar qualifications, and in offshore recruitment), and market confidence
effects (whi¢h*eoulldsextend to the whole China market or beyond).

19. Scenarios depend significantly on the duration of the border closure, and how New Zealand is
s€enj\to Manage this in the international context. Co-operation with China, student welfare,
and/flexibility in contractual and visa arrangements will all affect long-run market confidence.
